  abstract = "INTRODUCTIONThe electroretinogram (ERG) is an
              electrophysiological tool used to measure electrical activity
              originating in the outer retina in response to a light stimulus.
              Defects occurring at various levels of the retina can easily be
              detected by ERG measurements. Furthermore, the shape of the ERG
              response points toward the likely retinal cell type responsible
              for the deficit. Thus, this method is particularly useful for a
              rapid assessment of retinal function in genetically or
              pharmacologically manipulated animals. A typical ERG curve can be
              subdivided into three components: a small initial a-wave
              originating in photoreceptor activity, a large positive b-wave
              reflecting mainly ON bipolar cell depolarization, and a d-wave
              occurring at light offset. Here we present a noninvasive protocol
              for taking ERG measurements in larval zebrafish (4-7 days
              post-fertilization [dpf]). We use an extracellular recording
              electrode which is placed onto the surface of the cornea of the
              larva, and a light flash of a defined intensity and duration
              which is applied to evoke a response. In a typical larval ERG
              trace, we are able to record ERG a-, b-, and d-waves.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Visual information is transmitted to the vertebrate
              brain exclusively via the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).
              The functional diversity of RGCs generates multiple
              representations of the visual environment that are transmitted to
              several brain areas. However, in no vertebrate species has a
              complete wiring diagram of RGC axonal projections been
              constructed. We employed sparse genetic labeling and in vivo
              imaging of the larval zebrafish to generate a cellular-resolution
              map of projections from the retina to the brain. RESULTS: Our
              data define 20 stereotyped axonal projection patterns, the
              majority of which innervate multiple brain areas. Morphometric
              analysis of pre- and postsynaptic RGC structure revealed more
              than 50 structural RGC types with unique combinations of
              dendritic and axonal morphologies, exceeding current estimates of
              RGC diversity in vertebrates. These single-cell projection
              mapping data indicate that specific projection patterns are
              nonuniformly specified in the retina to generate retinotopically
              biased visual maps throughout the brain. The retinal projectome
              also successfully predicted a functional subdivision of the
              pretectum. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that RGC projection
              patterns are precisely coordinated to generate
              brain-area-specific visual representations originating from RGCs
              with distinct dendritic morphologies and topographic

              habituation. Results concerning stimulus generalization and
              dishabituation strongly suggest that neither motor fatigue nor
              sensory adaptation can account for the response waning. The
              effects of morphine and naloxone on performance were also
              studied. Neither 50 nor 5 micrograms morphine/g exerted any
              modulatory effect on memory retention. A dose of 50 micrograms
              morphine/g produced an anterograde detrimental effect on
              responsiveness but no long-term training effects could be
              detected after the drug's period of action. A dose of naloxone of
              1.6 micrograms/g did not antagonize the effect of morphine. The
              potential value of the response habituation as a model for

              subserve it, and also for elucidating the effects of opiates on

              Mice carrying a heterozygous null mutation of the Nfl gene
              (Nfl(+/-) show important features of the learning deficits
              associated with NF1 (ref. 2). Although neurofibromin has several
              known properties and functions, including Ras GTPase-activating
              protein activity, adenylyl cyclase modulation and microtubule
              binding, it is unclear which of these are essential for learning

              Nf1(+/-) mice can be rescued by genetic and pharmacological
              manipulations that decrease Ras function. We also show that the

              function. Our results indicate that the learning deficits
              associated with NF1 may be caused by excessive Ras activity,
              which leads to impairments in long-term potentiation caused by
              increased GABA-mediated inhibition. Our findings have

  abstract = "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant genetic disorder
              that causes tumors of the peripheral nervous system. In addition,
              >40\% of afflicted children have learning difficulties. The NF1
              protein contains a highly conserved GTPase-activating protein
              domain that inhibits Ras activity, and the C-terminal region
              regulates cAMP levels via G-protein-dependent activation of
              adenylyl cyclase. Behavioral analysis indicates that learning is
              disrupted in both Drosophila and mouse NF1 models. Our previous
              work has shown that defective cAMP signaling leads to the
              learning phenotype in Drosophila Nf1 mutants. In the present
              report, our experiments showed that in addition to learning,
              long-term memory was also abolished in Nf1 mutants. However,
              altered NF1-regulated Ras activity is responsible for this defect
              rather than altered cAMP levels. Furthermore, by expressing
              clinically relevant human NF1 mutations and deletions in
              Drosophila Nf1-null mutants, we demonstrated that the GAP-related
              domain of NF1 was necessary and sufficient for long-term memory,
              whereas the C-terminal domain of NF1 was essential for immediate
              memory. Thus, we show that two separate functional domains of the

              low-risk preterm infants (29-35 weeks) were continuously recorded

              Throughout the recordings the light was on continuously, the
              feeding was done intra-gastrically every 2 h and the incubator

  abstract = "Neurons and circuits are remarkably dynamic. Their gross
              structure can change within minutes as neurons sprout and retract
              processes to form new synapses. Homeostatic processes acting to
              regulate neuronal activity contribute to these dynamics and
              predict that the dendritic dynamics within pools of neurons
              should vary systematically in accord with the activity levels of
              individual neurons in the pool during behaviour. Here we test
              this by taking advantage of a topographic map of recruitment of
              spinal motoneurons in zebrafish. In vivo imaging reveals that the
              dendritic filopodial dynamics of motoneurons map onto their
              recruitment pattern, with the most electrically active cells
              having the lowest dynamics. Genetic reduction of activity inverts
              this map of dynamics. We conclude that homeostatic mechanisms
              driven by a gradient of activity levels in a pool of neurons can
              drive an associated gradation in neuronal dendritic dynamics,
              potentially shaping connectivity within a functionally

              tegmentum. Fine dendrites are present, and mostly arise from
              three regions; from the terminus of each major dendrite and from
              the ventral surface of the perikaryon. The number and position of
              fine dendrites within each of these sets is variable, even among
              animals from a single isogenic clone. M-cells with improper
              numbers or positions of large dendrites were never encountered,
              even early in development. This suggests that their outgrowth is
              a highly directed process. Large numbers of afferent synapses are
              formed on the M-cell during the time of dendrite outgrowth. By
              day 6 there is a mosaic pattern of morphologically distinctive
              terminals that is similar to the pattern of the adult goldfish
              M-cell. Identified categories of terminals include (1) myelinated
              club endings, on the distal part of the lateral dendrite, (2)
              boutons, on the dendrites and perikaryon, (3) unmyelinated club
              endings, on the dorsomedial portion of the perikaryon adjacent to
              the axon cap, and (4) spiral fiber terminals within the axon cap.
              The nonrandom nature of the input may be ascertained by observing
              the distribution of electrotonic or gap junctions on the cell
              surface. These are frequently encountered on the initial segment
              of the axon (spiral fiber terminals), ventral dendrite and
              ventral perikaryon (boutons), and distal lateral dendrite
              (myelinated club endings). Gap junctions are only rarely observed
              on the dorsal surface of the cell, although this region, like
              others of the cell, receives large numbers of chemical synaptic
              contacts. This pattern is similar at all stages studied, which
              suggests that no large rearrangements in synaptic contacts occur
              during this developmental period. We discuss these observations
              in relation to the hypothesis that patterned dendritic growth of
              the M-cell is directed by synaptic interactions with the
              afferents.",

              stimulation. The source of this diminution was analyzed in the
              present studies by eliciting mechanoreceptor currents from
              control and habituated cells under voltage clamp control. The I-V
              plots obtained have a voltage-dependent region between -60 and
              -20 mV, and a linear voltage-independent region between -20 and
              20 mV, with a reversal potential near 20 mV. The slope of the
              linear region did not change as a result of habituation
              indicating that the maximum mechanoreceptor current, and hence
              the total number of mechanoreceptor channels, was the same in
              control and habituated cells. The mechanoreceptor current
              reversal potential was changed by only a few millivolts, from
              21.6 to 17.2 mV, leaving the driving force term for the
              mechanoreceptor current at resting potential relatively
              unchanged. On the other hand, the voltage-dependent region of the
              I-V plot became significantly steeper after habituation (9.6
              mV/e-fold change) compared to its value before habituation (12.3

              the voltage-dependent characteristic of the mechanoreceptor

              counted in the spinal cord, brainstem, hypothalamus, and
              thalamus. Little c-fos immunoreactivity was found in control
              animals. Prolonged inhalational anesthesia increased the number
              of labeled cells at several brainstem sites. Noxious stimulation
              of anesthetized rats induced c-fos within the neuraxis in
              patterns consistent with data obtained from electrophysiological
              studies and in additional locations for which few direct
              electrophysiological data are available, such as the
              ventrolateral medulla, the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, and
              the reuniens and paraventricular thalamic nuclei. Gentle
              mechanical stimulation was ineffective in inducing c-fos-like
              protein. The data suggest that c-fos can be used as a
              transynaptic marker for neuronal activity following noxious
              stimulation. However, c-fos is expressed only in some kinds of
              neurons following peripheral stimulation, and it therefore may be
              an incomplete marker for nociresponsive activity. In addition, at
              least a few neurons express c-fos protein in the absence of
              noxious stimulation. Experiments analyzing c-fos expression must
              be designed with care, as both extraneous stimuli and anesthetic
              depth influence the results.",

              was to explore the relation between electroencephalographic (EEG)
              power spectrum and acoustical stimulus threshold for arousal.
              After habituation to an acoustical stimulus (a 1,000-Hz sine
              tone, increasing 1.5 dB per second for 45 seconds), values for
              latency to arousal after acoustical stimulus onset were analyzed.

              slow wave sleep 2 (SWS-2) having higher arousal threshold than
              slow wave sleep 1 (SWS-1), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and

              and (2) to study the activity of dopamine neurons during the
              performance of cognitive tasks known to be impaired after lesions
              of these neurons. Monkeys that had previously learned a simple
              reaction time task were trained to perform a spatial delayed
              response task via two intermediate tasks. During the learning of
              each new task, a total of 25\% of 76 dopamine neurons showed
              phasic responses to the delivery of primary liquid reward,
              whereas only 9\% of 163 neurons responded to this event once task
              performance was established. This produced an average population
              response during but not after learning of each task. Reward
              responses during learning were significantly more numerous and
              pronounced in area A10, as compared to areas A8 and A9. Dopamine
              neurons also showed phasic responses to the two conditioned
              stimuli. These were the instruction cue, which was the first
              stimulus in each trial and indicated the target of the upcoming
              arm movement (58\% of 76 neurons during and 44\% of 163 neurons
              after learning), and the trigger stimulus, which was a
              conditioned incentive stimulus predicting reward and eliciting a
              saccadic eye movement and an arm reaching movement (38\% of
              neurons during and 40\% after learning). None of the dopamine
              neurons showed sustained activity in the delay between the
              instruction and trigger stimuli that would resemble the activity
              of neurons in dopamine terminal areas, such as the striatum and
              frontal cortex. Thus, dopamine neurons respond phasically to
              alerting external stimuli with behavioral significance whose
              detection is crucial for learning and performing delayed response
              tasks. The lack of sustained activity suggests that dopamine
              neurons do not encode representational processes, such as working
              memory, expectation of external stimuli or reward, or preparation
              of movement. Rather, dopamine neurons are involved with transient

              for the study of development in general and neural development in
              particular. Although the development of both the optic nerve and
              the retinotectal projection of the zebrafish has been described,
              the retinofugal projection in its entirety has not. This paper
              describes it and also addresses the issue of projectional
              exuberance: i.e., transient projections to targets that are not
              innervated in the adult. The retinofugal projection of embryonic
              and larval zebrafish (32 hours to 7 days post-fertilization) was
              labeled by intraocular injection of DiI
              (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3',tetramethylindocarbocyanine
              perchlorate) and then studied in wholemounts and sections. The
              first optic axons crossed the chiasm at 32 hours
              post-fertilization and projected in a straight line to reach the
              tectum at about 44 hours. At 48 hours, a few optic axons deviated
              along either the tract of the posterior commissure or the tract
              of the postoptic commissure. By 72 hours (about the time of
              hatching) optic axons arborized in ten distinct regions, termed
              arborization fields. At 6-7 days post-fertilization, the same ten
              arborization fields (nine contralateral, one bilateral) were
              evident. Most of the arborization fields were located in the
              superficial neuropil and were not associated with morphologically
              identifiable clusters of somata. On the basis of various
              landmarks, the ten arborization fields are identified as
              precursors of retinorecipient nuclei previously described in
              other adult cypriniform fishes. The development was characterized
              by the nearly complete absence of any transient projections.

              on reflex pharyngeal dilator muscle activation by stimuli of
              negative airway pressure in human subjects. Intra-oral bipolar
              surface electrodes were used to record genioglossus
              electromyogram (EMG) responses to 500 ms duration pressure
              stimuli of 0 and -25 cmH2O applied, via a face-mask, in four

              sleep, defined by electroencephalographic (EEG) criteria. The
              rectified and integrated EMG responses to repeated interventions
              were bin averaged for the 0 and -25 cmH2O stimuli applied in
              wakefulness and sleep. Response latency was defined as the time
              when the EMG activity significantly increased above prestimulus
              levels. Response magnitude was quantified as the in ratio of the
              EMG activity for an 80 ms post-stimulus period to an 80 ms
              prestimulus period; data from after the subject's voluntary
              reaction time for tongue protrusion (range, 150-230 ms) were not
              analysed. Application of the -25 cmH2O stimuli caused
              genioglossus muscle activation in wakefulness and sleep, but in
              all subjects response magnitude was reduced in sleep (mean
              decrease, 61\%; range, 52-82\%; P = 0.011, Student's paired t
              test). In addition, response latency was increased in sleep in
              each subject (mean latency awake, 38 ms; range, 30-50 ms; mean
              latency asleep, 75 ms; range, 40-110 ms; P = 0.072, Student's
              paired t test). Application of the -25 cmH2O stimuli caused
              arousal from sleep on 90\% occasions, but in all cases the reflex
              genioglossus muscle responses (maximum latency, 110 ms) always
              proceeded any sign of EEG arousal (mean time to arousal, 643 ms;
              range, 424-760 ms). These results show that non-REM sleep
              attenuates reflex genioglossus muscle activation by stimuli of
              negative airway pressure. Attenuation of this reflex by sleep may
              impair the ability of the upper airway to defend itself from
              suction collapse by negative pressures generated during
              inspiration; this may have implications for the pathogenesis of

              from the first application of such a large-scale genetic
              screening to vertebrate development. Male zebrafish were
              mutagenized with N-ethyl N-nitrosourea to induce mutations in
              spermatogonial cells at an average specific locus rate of one in
              651 mutagenized genomes. Mutations were transmitted to the F1
              generation, and 2205 F2 families were raised. F3 embryos from
              sibling crosses within the F2 families were screened for
              developmental abnormalities. A total of 2337 mutagenized genomes
              were analyzed, and 2383 mutations resulting in abnormal embryonic
              and early larval phenotypes were identified. The phenotypes of
              695 mutants indicated involvement of the identified loci in
              specific aspects of embryogenesis. These mutations were
              maintained for further characterization and were classified into
              categories according to their phenotypes. The analyses and
              genetic complementation of mutations from several categories are
              reported in separate manuscripts. Mutations affecting
              pigmentation, motility, muscle and body shape have not been
              extensively analyzed and are listed here. A total of 331
              mutations were tested for allelism within their respective
              categories. This defined 220 genetic loci with on average 1.5
              alleles per locus. For about two-thirds of all loci only one
              allele was isolated. Therefore it is not possible to give a
              reliable estimate on the degree of saturation reached in our
              screen; however, the number of genes that can mutate to visible
              embryonic and early larval phenotypes in zebrafish is expected to
              be several-fold larger than the one for which we have observed
              mutant alleles during the screen. This screen demonstrates that
              mutations affecting a variety of developmental processes can be
              efficiently recovered from zebrafish.",

              behavior: the central nervous system (CNS) and skeletal muscles.
              To identify genes that are functionally involved in mediating and
              controlling different patterns of embryonic and larval motility,
              we included a simple touch response test in our zebrafish
              large-scale genetic screen. In total we identified 166 mutants
              with specific defects in embryonic motility. These mutants fall
              into 14 phenotypically distinct groups comprising at least 48
              genes. Here we describe the various phenotypic groups including
              mutants with no or reduced motility, mechanosensory defective
              mutants, 'spastic' mutants, circling mutants and motor circuit
              defective mutants. In 63 mutants, defining 18 genes, striation of
              somitic muscles is reduced. Phenotypic analysis provides evidence
              that these 18 genes have distinct and consecutive functions
              during somitic muscle development. The genes sloth (slo) and
              frozen (fro) already act during myoblast differentiation, while
              13 genes appear to function later, in the formation of myofibers
              and the organization of sarcomeres. Mutations in four other genes
              result in muscle-specific degeneration. 103 mutations, defining
              at least 30 genes, cause no obvious defects in muscle formation
              and may instead affect neuronal development. Analysis of the
              behavioral defects suggests that these genes participate in the
              diverse locomotion patterns observed, such as touch response,
              rhythmic tail movements, equilibrium control, or that they simply
              confer general motility to the animal. In some of these mutants
              specific defects in the developing nervous system are detected.
              Mutations in two genes, nevermind (nev) and macho (mao), affect
              axonal projection in the optic tectum, whereas axon formation and

              results of the complementation analysis of mutants belonging to
              two major classes: (1) mutants with defects in the mandibular and
              hyoid arches and (2) mutants with defects in cartilage

              arches largely unaffected (schmerle, sucker, hoover and
              sturgeon). In these mutants ventral components of the mandibular
              and hyoid arches are reduced (Meckel's cartilage and ceratohyal
              cartilage) whereas dorsal structures (palatoquadrate and

              and second arch structures but also differentially affect
              development of the dorsal and ventral structures within one arch.
              In 27 mutants that define at least 8 genes, the differentiation
              of cartilage and growth is affected. In hammerhead mutants
              particularly the mesodermally derived cartilages are reduced,

              reduction of all cartilaginous elements, leaving only two pieces

              shortened heads and reduced pectoral fins. In homozygous knorrig
              embryos, tumor-like outgrowths of chondrocytes occur along the
              edges of all cartilaginous elements. The mutants presented here

              along the anterior-posterior or dorsal-ventral axis, and the
              other affecting general features of brain morphology. The first

              level within 60 min. Moreover, exposure to hypo-osmotic
              conditions induced a biphasic increase in cytosolic Ca2+
              concentration ([Ca2+]i): a rapid peak-like increase was followed

              transcriptional activation by these factors. To facilitate this
              analysis, we developed an improved calcium phosphate
              coprecipitation procedure to transiently introduce DNA into
              primary neurons, both efficiently and consistently. Using this
              protocol, we demonstrate that the transcription factors serum
              response factor (SRF) and Elk-1 can mediate glutamate induction
              of transcription through the SRE in cortical neurons. There are
              at least two distinct pathways by which glutamate signals through
              the SRE: an SRF-dependent pathway that can operate in the absence
              of Elk and an Elk-dependent pathway. Activation of the
              Elk-dependent pathway of transcription seems to require
              phosphorylation of Elk-1 by extracellular signal-regulated
              kinases (ERKs), providing evidence for a physiological function
              of ERKs in glutamate signaling in neurons. Taken together, these
              findings suggest that SRF, Elk, and ERKs may have important roles
              in neuroplasticity.",

              others lack PKA sites but contain MAP Kinase (MAPK)

              antibodies directed against tyrosine hydroxylase and

              group. All groups contained both dopaminergic and noradrenergic
              neurons. Interfascicular neurons formed a loose longitudinal
              column of approximately 16-20 multipolar neurons on each side of
              the medulla, whose rostrocaudal extension coincided roughly with
              the vagal lobe. These neurons were relatively large and had
              dendrites that arborized throughout the reticular formation and
              in the vagal lobe. They also contributed axonal processes to the
              longitudinal catecholamine bundle. Neurons associated with
              structures in the vagal area were mostly dopaminergic. Some cells
              had a short, thin apical process that arborized into a dense
              plexus near the ventricular surface, and all cells had a basal
              dendrite that divided into two main branches: one extended
              caudally to terminate in the commissural nucleus of Cajal and

              extended laterally and joined the longitudinal catecholamine

              densely packed, bipolar neurons. One process of these neurons
              contacted the ventricular surface in the area postrema, and one
              terminated in the commissural nucleus of Cajal. Collaterals from
              the latter innervated the superficial laminae of the vagal lobe

              activity in adult males and females. Gross locomotor activity was
              measured using infrared movement detectors. The effects of light,
              dark, and temperature on the amplitude, phase, and free-running
              periods of locomotor rhythms were determined. When zebrafish were
              maintained in a 12-h light:12 h dark cycle at 25 degrees C, 86\%
              of the fish were most active during the light phase of the cycle.
              The phases of free-running rhythms measured after transfer of
              fish from light cycles to constant conditions indicate that this
              diurnal activity profile reflects entrained circadian
              rhythmicity. When animals were maintained in constant conditions,
              the proportion that expressed significant circadian rhythmicity
              depended on ambient temperature. At 21 degrees C, 73\% of the
              animals were rhythmic in constant darkness, and 65\% were
              rhythmic in constant light. Fewer (28-59\%) were rhythmic at 18

              of rhythmic animals was not affected by temperature within this

  abstract = "The effects of lesions, receptor blocking, electrical
              self-stimulation, and drugs of abuse suggest that midbrain
              dopamine systems are involved in processing reward information
              and learning approach behavior. Most dopamine neurons show phasic
              activations after primary liquid and food rewards and
              conditioned, reward-predicting visual and auditory stimuli. They
              show biphasic, activation-depression responses after stimuli that
              resemble reward-predicting stimuli or are novel or particularly
              salient. However, only few phasic activations follow aversive
              stimuli. Thus dopamine neurons label environmental stimuli with
              appetitive value, predict and detect rewards and signal alerting
              and motivating events. By failing to discriminate between
              different rewards, dopamine neurons appear to emit an alerting
              message about the surprising presence or absence of rewards. All
              responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli depend on
              event predictability. Dopamine neurons are activated by rewarding
              events that are better than predicted, remain uninfluenced by
              events that are as good as predicted, and are depressed by events
              that are worse than predicted. By signaling rewards according to
              a prediction error, dopamine responses have the formal
              characteristics of a teaching signal postulated by reinforcement
              learning theories. Dopamine responses transfer during learning
              from primary rewards to reward-predicting stimuli. This may
              contribute to neuronal mechanisms underlying the retrograde
              action of rewards, one of the main puzzles in reinforcement
              learning. The impulse response releases a short pulse of dopamine
              onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather global
              reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons. This signal may
              improve approach behavior by providing advance reward information
              before the behavior occurs, and may contribute to learning by
              modifying synaptic transmission. The dopamine reward signal is
              supplemented by activity in neurons in striatum, frontal cortex,
              and amygdala, which process specific reward information but do
              not emit a global reward prediction error signal. A cooperation
              between the different reward signals may assure the use of
              specific rewards for selectively reinforcing behaviors. Among the
              other projection systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly
              serve attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons code
              rewards heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing fibers signal errors
              in motor performance or errors in the prediction of aversive
              events to cerebellar Purkinje cells. Most deficits following
              dopamine-depleting lesions are not easily explained by a
              defective reward signal but may reflect the absence of a general
              enabling function of tonic levels of extracellular dopamine. Thus
              dopamine systems may have two functions, the phasic transmission
              of reward information and the tonic enabling of postsynaptic
              neurons.",

              influence gene regulation and cell differentiation in a variety

              plausible mechanism for coordinating cellular processes during
              embryogenesis. Herein we report use of aequorin and a photon
              imaging microscope to directly observe a rhythmic series of
              intercellular calcium waves that circumnavigate zebrafish embryos
              over a 10-h period during gastrulation and axial segmentation.
              These waves first appeared at about 65\% epiboly and continued to
              arise every 5-10 min up to at least the 16-somite stage. The
              waves originated from loci of high calcium activity bordering the
              blastoderm margin. Several initiating loci were active early in
              the wave series, whereas later a dorsal marginal midline locus
              predominated. On completion of epiboly, the dorsal locus was
              incorporated into the developing tail bud and continued to
              generate calcium waves. The locations and timing at which calcium
              dynamics are most active appear to correspond closely to

              several recent advances, which have focused attention on
              calcium-regulated pathways controlling transcription. One of the
              molecules implicated by pharmacological, biochemical and genetic
              approaches is the calcium/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase,
              calcineurin. In lymphocytes, calcineurin responds to specific
              calcium signals and regulates expression of several immediate
              early genes by controlling the nuclear import of the NF-ATc
              family of transcription factors. Here we show that NF-ATc4/NF-AT3
              in hippocampal neurons can rapidly translocate from cytoplasm to
              nucleus and activate NF-AT-dependent transcription in response to
              electrical activity or potassium depolarization. The
              calcineurin-mediated translocation is critically dependent on
              calcium entry through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.
              GSK-3 can phosphorylate NF-ATc4, promoting its export from the
              nucleus and antagonizing NF-ATc4-dependent transcription.
              Furthermore, we show that induction of the inositol

              receptors having characteristics similar to those described for

              alpha-bungarotoxin both acetylcholine (ACh) and nicotine evoked
              currents with respective EC50 values of 4.3 and 3.4 microM. The
              maximal nicotine-activated response, however, was only 56\% that
              of the maximal ACh current. It was previously shown that 10 to
              100 mM of ethanol potentiated ACh-mediated currents in these
              neurons. We demonstrate that 100 mM ethanol similarly potentiates
              currents evoked by 300 nM (40\%) and 1 microM nicotine 61\%).
              This suggests that an ethanol-induced potentiation of nicotinic
              currents may enhance the acute positive reinforcement associated
              with nicotine and could increase tobacco use during heavy ethanol
              intake. However, further experimentation indicated that the

              ACh-evoked currents by 38, 54, and 62\%, respectively, with
              little direct receptor-channel activation. The residual ACh
              currents of nicotine-desensitized receptor channels were
              potentiated by 100 mM ethanol to nearly the extent as were the
              undesensitized control responses. We propose that the opposing

              explain the increased tobacco use observed with excessive
              drinking. Thus, ethanol has a dual effect regarding nicotine. It
              enhances acute nicotine-mediated receptor activation, although

              subclasses of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades.
              Its phosphorylation strongly potentiates its ability to activate
              transcription of the c-fos promoter through a ternary complex
              assembled on the c-fos serum response element. In rat brain
              postmitotic neurons, Elk-1 is strongly expressed (V. Sgambato, P.
              Vanhoutte, C. Pag{\`e}s, M. Rogard, R. A. Hipskind, M. J. Besson,
              and J. Caboche, J. Neurosci. 18:214-226, 1998). However, its
              physiological role in these postmitotic neurons remains to be
              established. To investigate biochemically the signaling pathways
              targeting Elk-1 and c-fos in mature neurons, we used a semi-in
              vivo system composed of brain slices stimulated with the
              excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate treatment leads
              to a robust, progressive activation of the ERK and JNK/SAPK MAPK
              cascades. This corresponds kinetically to a significant increase
              in Ser383-phosphorylated Elk-1 and the appearance of c-fos mRNA.
              Glutamate also causes increased levels of Ser133-phosphorylated
              cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) but only
              transiently relative to Elk-1 and c-fos. ERK and Elk-1
              phosphorylation are blocked by the MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059,
              indicating the primary role of the ERK cascade in mediating
              glutamate signaling to Elk-1 in the rat striatum in vivo.
              Glutamate-mediated CREB phosphorylation is also inhibited by
              PD98059 treatment. Interestingly, KN62, which interferes with
              calcium-calmodulin kinase (CaM-K) activity, leads to a reduction
              of glutamate-induced ERK activation and of CREB phosphorylation.
              These data indicate that ERK functions as a common component in
              two signaling pathways (ERK/Elk-1 and ERK/?/CREB) converging on
              the c-fos promoter in postmitotic neuronal cells and that CaM-Ks

              because of their genetic attributes, transparency and relative
              simplicity. They have approximately 200 neurons that project from
              the brainstem into the spinal cord. Many of these neurons can be
              individually identified and laser-ablated in intact larvae. This
              should facilitate cellular-level characterization of the
              descending control of larval behavior patterns. Towards this end,
              we attempt to describe the range of locomotor behavior patterns
              exhibited by zebrafish larvae. Using high-speed digital imaging,
              a variety of swimming and turning behaviors were analyzed in 6-
              to 9-day-old larval fish. Swimming episodes appeared to fall into
              two categories, with the point of maximal bending of the larva's
              body occurring either near the mid-body (burst swims) or closer
              to the tail (slow swims). Burst swims also involved
              larger-amplitude bending, faster speeds and greater yaw than slow
              swims. Turning behaviors clearly fell into two distinct
              categories: fast, large-angle escape turns characteristic of
              escape responses, and much slower routine turns lacking the large
              counterbend that often accompanies escape turns. Prey-capture
              behaviors were also recorded. They were made up of simpler
              locomotor components that appeared to be similar to routine turns
              and slow swims. The different behaviors observed were analyzed
              with regard to possible underlying neural control systems. Our

              neurons and helps to explain the need for the roughly 200

              cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and the ternary
              complex factor Elk-1, a key transcriptional-regulator of serum

              upregulated at the time point when MAPK/ERK phosphorylation had
              returned to basal levels, suggesting a negative feedback loop to
              regulate deactivation of MAPK/ERK. We also show that inhibition
              of the MAPK/ERK cascade by the MAPK kinase MEK inhibitor SL327
              prevented CREB and Elk-1 phosphorylation, and LTP-dependent gene
              induction, resulting in rapidly decaying LTP. In conclusion, we
              suggest that Elk-1 forms an important link in the MAP kinase
              pathway to transduce signals from the cell surface to the nucleus
              to activate the genetic machinery necessary for the maintenance
              of synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Thus, MAPK/ERK
              activation is required for LTP-dependent transcriptional
              regulation and we suggest this is regulated by two parallel

  abstract = "The vertebrate optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is a compensatory
              oculomotor behavior that is evoked by movement of the visual
              environment. It functions to stabilize visual images on the
              retina. The OKN can be experimentally evoked by rotating a drum
              fitted with stripes around the animal and has been studied
              extensively in many vertebrate species, including teleosts. This
              simple behavior has earlier been used to screen for mutations
              affecting visual system development in the vertebrate model
              organism zebrafish. In such a screen, we have found a significant
              number of homozygous belladonna (bel) mutant larvae to be
              defective in the correct execution of the OKN [1]. We now show
              that about 40\% of homozygous bel larvae display a curious
              reversal of the OKN upon visual stimulation. Monocular
              stimulation leads to primary activation of ipsilateral eye
              movements in larvae that behave like the wild type. In contrast,
              affected larvae display contralateral activation of eye movements
              upon monocular stimulation. Anatomical analysis of retinal
              ganglion cell axon projections reveal a morphological basis for
              the observed behavioral defect. All animals with OKN reversal are
              achiasmatic. Further behavioral examination of affected larvae
              show that OKN-reversed animals execute this behavior in a

              forced to swim in the water tunnel, zebrafish tended to turn and
              swim downstream for short periods at slow water velocities.
              Turning frequencies (turns per minute, f(T)) at the slowest

  abstract = "Spemann's organizer plays an essential role in patterning the
              vertebrate embryo. During gastrulation, organizer cells involute
              and form the prechordal plate anteriorly and the notochord more
              posteriorly. The fate mapping and gene expression analyses in
              zebrafish presented in this study reveal that this
              anteroposterior polarity is already initiated in the organizer
              before gastrulation. Prechordal plate progenitors reside close to
              the blastoderm margin and express the homeobox gene goosecoid,
              whereas notochord precursors are located further from the margin
              and express the homeobox gene floating head. The nodal-related
              genes cyclops and squint are expressed at the blastoderm margin
              and are required for prechordal plate and notochord formation. We
              show that differential activation of the Nodal signaling pathway
              is essential in establishing anteroposterior pattern in the
              organizer. First, overexpression of cyclops and squint at
              different doses leads to the induction of floating head at low
              doses and the induction of both goosecoid and floating head at
              higher doses. Second, decreasing Nodal signaling using different
              concentrations of the antagonist Antivin inhibits goosecoid
              expression at low doses and blocks expression of both goosecoid
              and floating head at higher doses. Third, attenuation of Nodal
              signaling in zygotic mutants for the EGF-CFC gene one-eyed
              pinhead, an essential cofactor for Nodal signaling, leads to the
              loss of goosecoid expression and expansion of floating head
              expression in the organizer. Concomitantly, cells normally fated
              to become prechordal plate are transformed into notochord
              progenitors. Finally, activation of Nodal signaling at different
              times suggests that prechordal plate specification requires
              sustained Nodal signaling, whereas transient signaling is
              sufficient for notochord development. Together, these results
              indicate that differential Nodal signaling patterns the organizer
              before gastrulation, with the highest level of activity required
              for anterior fates and lower activity essential for posterior

              studies indicates that auditory information processing is
              selectively affected, even at early phases, across the different
              stages of sleep-wakefulness continuum. According to these
              studies, 3 main conclusions are drawn: (1) the sleeping brain is
              able to automatically detect stimulus occurrence and trigger an
              orienting response towards that stimulus if its degree of novelty
              is large; (2) auditory stimuli are represented in the auditory
              system and maintained for a period of time in sensory memory,
              making the automatic-change detection during sleep possible; and
              (3) there are specific brain mechanisms (sleep-specific ERP
              components associated with the presence of vertex waves and
              K-complexes) by which information processing can be improved
              during non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, the remarkably
              affected amplitude and latency of the waking-ERPs during the
              different stages of sleep suggests deficits in the building and
              maintenance of a neural representation of the stimulus as well as
              in the process by which neural events lead to an orienting
              response toward such a stimulus. The deactivation of areas in the
              dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex during sleep contributing to the
              generation of these ERP components is hypothesized to be one of
              the main causes for the attenuated amplitude of these ERPs during

              to separate data into maximally independent groups. Achieving
              maximal independence in space or time yields two varieties of ICA
              meaningful for functional MRI (fMRI) applications: spatial ICA
              (SICA) and temporal ICA (TICA). SICA has so far dominated the
              application of ICA to fMRI. The objective of these experiments
              was to study ICA with two predictable components present and
              evaluate the importance of the underlying independence assumption
              in the application of ICA. Four novel visual activation paradigms
              were designed, each consisting of two spatiotemporal components
              that were either spatially dependent, temporally dependent, both
              spatially and temporally dependent, or spatially and temporally
              uncorrelated, respectively. Simulated data were generated and
              fMRI data from six subjects were acquired using these paradigms.
              Data from each paradigm were analyzed with regression analysis in
              order to determine if the signal was occurring as expected.
              Spatial and temporal ICA were then applied to these data, with
              the general result that ICA found components only where expected,
              e.g., S(T)ICA ``failed'' (i.e., yielded independent components
              unrelated to the ``self-evident'' components) for paradigms that
              were spatially (temporally) dependent, and ``worked'' otherwise.
              Regression analysis proved a useful ``check'' for these data,
              however strong hypotheses will not always be available, and a
              strength of ICA is that it can characterize data without making
              specific modeling assumptions. We report a careful examination of
              some of the assumptions behind ICA methodologies, provide
              examples of when applying ICA would provide
              difficult-to-interpret results, and offer suggestions for

              a riboprobe specific for the long form of the leptin receptor

              the hypoglossal, trigeminal, lateral reticular, and cochlear
              nuclei; locus ceruleus; and inferior olive. The anatomical

              specific to Ob-Rb. In a second experiment, exploring the
              relevance of CBS Ob-Rb to feeding behavior, rats were given a

              reduced food intake significantly at 2, 4, and 24 h after

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Identification of the brain regions involved in
              ethanol administration is important for understanding the
              neurobiology of ethanol addiction. Animal studies with different
              brain mapping techniques found that voluntary ethanol
              self-administration leads to changes in activity of specific
              brain regions in patterns that only partially overlap with
              patterns of brain regions affected by involuntary (i.e.,
              experimenter-administered) ethanol administration. As an
              extension of studies mapping changes in neural activity after
              voluntary ethanol drinking, this study analyzed expression of the
              inducible transcription factor c-Fos after ethanol consumption in
              an operant procedure. METHODS: AA (Alko alcohol) rats were
              trained to operantly respond for water, 0.2\% saccharin, 0.2\%
              saccharin/10\% (w/v) ethanol, or 10\% ethanol in a 30-min
              limited-access procedure. Animals were allowed to self-administer
              solutions for at least 40 ethanol response sessions and were
              killed 1.5 hr after beginning of the last session. Forty-seven
              brain regions were immunohistochemically analyzed for c-Fos
              expression. RESULTS: In this paradigm, ethanol dose-dependently
              increased c-Fos expression in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW)
              and decreased expression in the dorsal tenia tecta compared with
              no-ethanol controls. No effects of saccharin on c-Fos expression
              were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our results extend previous findings of
              preferential sensitivity of EW to alcohol in voluntary
              self-administration procedures to operant responding for ethanol
              and warrant further investigation of ethanol's effects on the EW.
              The finding that ethanol attenuated c-Fos expression in the tenia
              tecta is novel. Taken together, these findings confirm that
              voluntary ethanol self-administration leads to changes in
              activity of a limited number of brain regions with previously
              unexamined roles in ethanol sensitivity and addiction.",

              a counter-turn, and a bout of rapid swimming, are initiated by
              firing of the Mauthner cell and two segmental homologs. However,
              after laser-ablation of the Mauthner cell and its homologs,
              escape-like behaviors still occur, albeit at a much longer
              latency. This might suggest that additional neurons contribute to
              this behavior. We therefore recorded the activity of other
              descending neurons in the brain stem using confocal imaging of
              cells retrogradely labeled with fluorescent calcium indicators. A
              large majority of identified descending neurons present in the

              contralaterally projecting reticulospinal neurons, as well as

              responses with the firing of action potentials, and because all
              responding cells have axons projecting into to spinal cord, this
              suggests that these cells are relaying escape-related information
              to spinal cord. Other identified neurons failed to show
              consistent calcium responses to escape-eliciting stimuli. In
              conjunction with previous lesion studies, these results indicate
              that the neural control systems for turning and swimming

              development of DRG and sympathetic neurons during development in

              axial kinematics of larval zebrafish as they preyed upon
              paramecia and also during other types of swimming. In all types

              caudal direction. The prey capture swim bouts appeared to be more
              complex than other swim patterns examined. In the capture swim
              bouts, the initial bends were of low amplitude and were most
              prominent at far-caudal locations during each individual
              traveling wave of bending. Later bends in the bout (occurring
              just prior to prey capture) appeared to originate more rostrally

              mutants. Zebrafish heart, kidney, and embryonic cell lines
              contain circadian oscillators and phototransduction mechanisms
              for entrainment, suggesting that circadian pacemaking functions
              may be distributed throughout the animal. Studies of circadian
              system development in zebrafish have found that a molecular
              circadian oscillation in unfertilized oocytes persists through
              embryonic development with its phase intact, but that the
              pacemakers that drive rhythms of melatonin synthesis and behavior
              require environmental entraining signals late in development for
              initial synchronization. Zebrafish homologs of several of the
              core clock genes identified in other animals have been cloned.
              Transcripts for most of these are rhythmically expressed in
              multiple tissues. The interactions of clock gene products are for
              the most part similar to their interactions in mammals, although

  abstract = "Information provided by external stimuli does reach the brain
              during sleep, although the amount of information is reduced
              during sleep compared to wakefulness. The process controlling
              this reduction is called 'sensory' gating and evidence exists
              that the underlying neurophysiological processes take place in
              the thalamus. Furthermore, it is clear that stimuli given during
              sleep can alter the functional state of the brain. Two factors
              have been shown to play a crucial role in causing changes in the
              sleeping brain: the intensity and the relevance of the stimulus.
              Intensive stimuli arouse the brain, as well as stimuli having a
              high informational impact on the sleeping person. The arousal
              threshold for important stimuli is quite low compared to neutral
              stimuli. A central question in sleep research is whether
              associative learning, or in other words the formation of new
              associations between stimuli, can take place in a sleeping brain.
              It has been shown that simple forms of learning are still
              possible during sleep. In sleeping rats, it is proven that
              habituation, an active, simple form of learning not to respond to
              irrelevant stimuli, can occur. Moreover, there is evidence for
              the view that more complex associations can be modulated and
              newly formed during sleep. This is shown by two experimental
              approaches: an extinction paradigm and a latent inhibition
              (pre-exposure) paradigm. The presentation of non-reinforced
              stimuli during sleep causes slower extinction compared to the
              same presentation of these stimuli during wakefulness.
              Consistently, the suppressive capacity of a stimulus in the
              latent inhibition paradigm is less when previously pre-exposed
              during sleep, as compared to pre-exposure during wakefulness.
              Thus, while associative learning is not completely blocked during
              sleep, aspects of association formation are clearly altered.
              However, animal studies also clearly indicate that complex forms
              of learning are not possible during sleep. It is hypothesised
              that this restriction in information processing during sleep is
              due to the considerable reduction of incoming information by the
              sleeping brain. This reduction may serve to protect the sleep
              process.",

              that were taking part in the transmission of various noxious
              signals. The electrical stimulation of Adelta fibers induced pERK
              primarily in neurons with myelinated fibers. c-Fiber activation
              by capsaicin injection induced pERK in small neurons with
              unmyelinated fibers containing vanilloid receptor-1 (VR-1),
              suggesting that pERK labeling in DRG neurons is modality
              specific. Electrical stimulation at the c-fiber level with
              different intensities and frequencies revealed that
              phosphorylation of ERK is dependent on the frequency. We examined
              the pERK in the DRG after application of natural noxious stimuli
              and found a stimulus intensity-dependent increase in labeled cell
              size and in the number of activated neurons in the c- and
              Adelta-fiber population. Immunohistochemical double labeling with
              phosphorylated ERK/VR-1 and pharmacological study demonstrated
              that noxious heat stimulation induced pERK in primary afferents

              also increased pERK labeling significantly in peripheral fibers

              primary afferent neurons is involved in the sensitization of
              primary afferent neurons. Thus, pERK in primary afferents by
              noxious stimulation in vivo showed distinct characteristics of

              the direct and indirect striatal projection neurons. After
              degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine system, direct pathway
              neurons display a supersensitive response to D1 dopamine receptor
              agonists, which is demonstrated by the induction of immediate
              early genes (IEGs), such as c-fos. Here we show, using analysis
              of receptor-mediated signal transduction, including protein
              phosphorylation and induction of IEGs, that D1 dopamine receptor
              supersensitivity is attributable to a switch to ERK1/2/MAP kinase
              (extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein
              kinase) in direct pathway neurons. Normally, in the
              dopamine-intact striatum, activation of ERK1/2/MAP kinase is
              shown to be restricted to indirect and not direct pathway neurons
              in response to stimulation of corticostriatal afferents.
              Moreover, in the dopamine-intact striatum, treatment with full D1
              dopamine receptor agonists or stimulation of nigrostriatal
              dopaminergic afferents, both of which result in the induction of

              activated in direct pathway neurons in response to D1 dopamine

              of corticostriatal afferents. Inhibitors of MEK (MAP kinase
              kinase), which is responsible for phosphorylation of ERK1/2/MAP

              ERK1/2/MAP kinase in the dopamine-depleted striatum, as well as
              the supersensitive induction of IEGs. These results demonstrate

              clinical change spans a continuum from complete remission to
              worsening (in 2-7\%). Other side effects are sleepiness and
              (hypo-) mania. Sleep deprivation (SD) response shows up in the SD
              night or on the following day. Ten to 15\% of patients respond
              after recovery sleep only. After recovery sleep 50-80\% of day 1
              responders suffer a complete or partial relapse; but improvement
              can last for weeks. Sleep seems to lead to relapse although this
              is not necessarily the case. Treatment effects may be stabilised
              by antidepressant drugs, lithium, shifting of sleep time or light
              therapy. The best predictor of a therapeutic effect is a large
              variability of mood. Current opinion is that partial sleep

              effective as TSD. There are, however, indications that TSD is
              superior. Early PSD (i.e. sleeping between 3:00 and 6:00) has the
              same effect as late PSD given equal sleep duration. New data cast
              doubt on the time-honoured conviction that REM sleep deprivation
              is more effective than non-REM SD. Both may work by reducing
              total sleep time. SD is an unspecific therapy. The main

              substances according to their edibility. The adult gustatory
              system in fish has been studied thoroughly, including
              regeneration experiments. Taste buds occur in the epithelia of
              the lips, the mouth cavity, the oropharyngeal cavity, and also in
              the skin of the barbels, the head, and sometimes even all over

              known about the ontogeny of the fish taste system. We examined
              the development of taste buds in the zebrafish on the light
              microscopical and the scanning and transmission electron
              microscopical levels. Taste buds develop later than the olfactory
              organ and the solitary chemosensory cells, two other chemosensory
              systems in aquatic vertebrates. The first few taste bud primordia
              are visible within the epithelia of lips and gill arches 3 to 4
              days after fertilization, and the first few taste buds with open
              receptor areas appear on the lips and simultaneously on the gill
              arches 4-5 days after fertilization, which coincides with the
              onset of feeding. Taste buds in the mouth cavity, on the head,
              and on the barbels are formed later in development. As seen in

              amplitude was higher after four LD cycles than after three LD

              (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1) and ERK2 signal
              duration. When ERK activation is transient, its activity declines
              before the c-Fos protein accumulates, and under these conditions
              c-Fos is unstable. However, when ERK signalling is sustained,
              c-Fos is phosphorylated by still-active ERK and RSK
              (90K-ribosomal S6 kinase). Carboxy-terminal phosphorylation
              stabilizes c-Fos and primes additional phosphorylation by
              exposing a docking site for ERK, termed the FXFP (DEF) domain.
              Mutating the DEF domain disrupts the c-Fos sensor and

              circadium rhythms also contain putative DEF domains, indicating

              functional role at intact synapses. In the present study,
              injection of synthetic mRNA for synaptophysin into one of the
              early blastomeres of a Xenopus embryo resulted in elevated
              synaptophysin expression in 1 and 2 d embryos and in cultured
              spinal neurons derived from the injected blastomere, as shown by
              immunocytochemistry. At neuromuscular synapses made by neurons
              overexpressing synaptophysin [p38(+)] in 1 d cell cultures, the
              spontaneous synaptic currents (SSCs) showed a markedly higher
              frequency, as compared to control synapses. This increase in
              frequency was not accompanied by a change in the mean amplitude

              roles in the differentiation and survival of projection neurons
              within the retina, inner ear, dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia.
              During retinal ganglion cell differentiation, Brn3b is expressed
              first, followed by Brn3a and Brn3c. Targeted deletion of Brn3b,
              but not Brn3a or Brn3c, leads to a loss of most retinal ganglion
              cells before birth. However, as a few retinal ganglion cells are
              still present in Brn3b(-/-) mice, Brn3a and Brn3c may partially
              compensate for the loss of Brn3b. To examine the role of Brn3c in
              retinal ganglion cell development, we generated Brn3b/Brn3c
              double knockout mice and analyzed their retinas and optic
              chiasms. Retinal ganglion cell axons from double knockout mice
              were more severely affected than were those from Brn3b-deficient
              mice, indicating that Brn3c was required for retinal ganglion
              cell differentiation and could partially compensate for the loss
              of Brn3b. Moreover, Brn3c had functions in retinal ganglion cell
              differentiation separate from those of Brn3b. Ipsilateral and
              misrouted projections at the optic chiasm were overproduced in
              Brn3b(-/-) mice but missing were entirely in optic chiasms of
              Brn3b/Brn3c double knockout mice, suggesting that Brn3c
              controlled ipsilateral axon production. Forced expression of
              Brn3c in Brn3b(-/-) retinal explants restored neurite outgrowth,
              demonstrating that Brn3c could promote axon outgrowth in the
              absence of Brn3b. Our results reveal a complex genetic
              relationship between Brn3b and Brn3c in regulating the retinal

              necessary for the maturation of visual cortical circuits and acts
              through molecular mechanisms that are still poorly understood.
              Recently, it has been shown that ERK (extracellular
              signal-regulated kinase) 1/2, protein kinase A (PKA), and CREB
              (cAMP response element-binding protein) are crucial factors for
              experience-dependent development of the visual cortex, but very
              little is known about the role of visual experience in their
              activation. Here, we show that visual stimulation after a brief
              period of dark rearing caused a transient ERK activation in the
              visual cortex. Visually induced ERK activation occurred primarily
              in excitatory neurons of layers II-III and VI and was prevented
              by binocular lid suture. ERK phosphorylation was strongly reduced
              by cortical infusion with the cAMP-PKA inhibitor Rp-8-Cl-cAMPS,
              thus establishing a link between PKA and ERK activation. To
              analyze the downstream consequences of ERK and PKA signaling, we
              studied the action of visual stimulation on transcription of
              genes controlled by CREB in transgenic mice carrying the LacZ
              reporter gene under the control of the CRE (cAMP response
              element) promoter. Visual stimulation triggered a prolonged
              episode of CRE-mediated gene expression in the visual cortex that
              was suppressed by infusion with the ERK inhibitor U0126. Cortical
              administration of Rp-8-Cl-cAMPS attenuated the
              experience-dependent activation of CRE-mediated gene
              transcription. These results show that ERK phosphorylation in
              visual cortical neurons represents a molecular readout of
              patterned visual stimuli and that visual activation of ERK
              involves the cAMP-PKA system. Finally, because CRE-mediated gene
              expression was totally dependent on ERK activation, we suggest
              that PKA action on CRE-mediated gene expression is mediated by
              ERK.",

  abstract  = "The functions of sleep are still unknown, but are probably
               related to cellular and molecular aspects of neural function. To
               better understand the benefits that sleep may bring at the
               cellular level, recent studies have employed Drosophila
               melanogaster as a model system and shown that fruit flies share
               the fundamental features of mammalian sleep. As in mammals,
               sleep in Drosophila is characterized by increased arousal
               threshold and by changes in brain electrical activity. Fly sleep
               is homeostatically regulated independent of the circadian clock,
               is modulated by stimulants and hypnotics, and is affected by
               age. Also, fly sleep is associated with changes in brain gene
               expression similar to those observed in mammals. While
               Drosophila neurobiology is sufficiently complex to permit
               meaningful generalizations to mammals and humans, Drosophila
               genetics is simple enough to allow a rapid mutagenesis
               screening. An ongoing mutagenesis study has screened ∼5000
               mutant Drosophila lines and found that sleep amount, sleep
               pattern, and the homeostatic regulation of sleep are highly
               conserved phenotypes in flies. So far, this study has identified
               10 short sleeper lines and 4 lines that show no sleep rebound
               after sleep deprivation. Ultimately, the characterization of
               these lines should help identifying crucial cellular pathways
               involved in the regulatory mechanisms of sleep and its
               functional consequences. BioEssays 25:940--949, 2003.

              cerebrospinal fluid containing MS-222 at concentrations ranging
              from 0.1 to 1,000 micro M. At the lowest concentration of MS-222,

              Respiratory burst amplitude and burst duration were not affected

              not significantly change with the addition of MS-222 below 1,000

              projection pattern: 1) the preoptic complex (5 groups); 2) the
              posterior tuberal complex (4 groups); and 3) the hypothalamic

              distinguished: one group in the ventral thalamus; one in the
              pretectal area, and one found in the postoptic commissure and
              above the pituitary stalk in a few brains. Two dopaminergic
              pathways are defined: 1) the preoptico-hypophyseal tract runs in
              close association with the lateral forebrain bundle along the
              base of the brain between the preoptic area and the pituitary
              stalk, and neurons of the preoptic complex are major contributors
              to this pathway; additional fibers come from the large
              periventricular organ-associated neurons of the posterior
              tuberal; 2) the endohypothalamic tract links neurons of the
              hypothalamic complex and consists mainly of processes from
              hypothalamic neurons. Axons from neurons of the suprachiasmatic,

              tuberal and hypothalamic areas, optic tectum, and pituitary are
              the major targets of diencephalic dopaminergic neurons. The

              activates the NF-kappa B transcription factor by a pathway
              requiring the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase CaMKII and local
              submembranous Ca(2+) elevation. The p65:p50 NF-kappa B form is
              selectively localized at synapses; p65-deficient mice have no
              detectable synaptic NF-kappa B. Activated NF-kappa B moves to the
              nucleus and could directly transmute synaptic signals into
              altered gene expression. Mice lacking p65 show a selective
              learning deficit in the spatial version of the radial arm maze.
              These observations suggest that long-term changes to adult

              the tectum is limited. We began to address this issue using laser

              a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses green-fluorescent

              Neither OKR nor OMR were found to be dependent on intact

              presents a parallel implementation of a nonrigid image

              registration), the scaling behavior of the algorithm is
              quantitatively analyzed. The method is demonstrated to perform
              the computation of intra-operative brain deformation in less than
              a minute using 64 CPUs on a 128-CPU shared-memory supercomputer

              important in neuronal adaptive processes, such as the

              These long-term changes in synaptic strength are mediated through
              alterations in gene expression. However, many of the mechanisms
              by which BDNF is linked to transcriptional and translational
              regulation remain unknown. Recently, the transcription factor
              NFATc4 (nuclear factor of activated T-cells isoform 4) was
              discovered in neurons, where it is believed to play an important
              role in long-term changes in neuronal function. Interestingly,
              NFATc4 is particularly sensitive to the second messenger systems
              activated by BDNF. Thus, we hypothesized that NFAT-dependent
              transcription may be an important mediator of BDNF-induced
              plasticity. In cultured rat CA3-CA1 hippocampal neurons, BDNF
              activated NFAT-dependent transcription via TrkB receptors.
              Inhibition of calcineurin blocked BDNF-induced nuclear
              translocation of NFATc4, thus preventing transcription. Further,
              phospholipase C was a critical signaling intermediate between
              BDNF activation of TrkB and the initiation of NFAT-dependent
              transcription. Both inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)-mediated
              release of calcium from intracellular stores and activation of
              protein kinase C were required for BDNF-induced NFAT-dependent
              transcription. Finally, increased expression of IP3 receptor 1
              and BDNF after neuronal exposure to BDNF was linked to
              NFAT-dependent transcription. These results suggest that NFATc4

              relatively little is known about how the zebrafish digestive
              system forms. We define developmental milestones during
              organogenesis of the zebrafish digestive tract, liver, and
              pancreas and identify important differences in the way the
              digestive endoderm of zebrafish and amniotes is organized. Such
              differences account for the finding that the zebrafish digestive
              system is assembled from individual organ anlagen, whereas the
              digestive anlagen of amniotes arise from a primitive gut tube.
              Despite differences of organ morphogenesis, conserved molecular
              programs regulate pharynx, esophagus, liver, and pancreas
              development in teleosts and mammals. Specifically, we show that
              zebrafish faust/gata-5 is a functional ortholog of gata-4, a gene
              that is essential for the formation of the mammalian and avian
              foregut. Further, extraembryonic gata activity is required for
              this function in zebrafish as has been shown in other
              vertebrates. We also show that a loss-of-function mutation that
              perturbs sonic hedgehog causes defects in the development of the
              esophagus that parallel those associated with targeted disruption
              of this gene in mammals. Perturbation of sonic hedgehog also
              affects zebrafish liver and pancreas development, and these
              effects occur in a reciprocal fashion, as has been described
              during mammalian liver and ventral pancreas development.

              adenohypophysis development. Here we report the cloning and
              mutational analysis of a pit1 homolog from zebrafish. Compared
              with mouse, zebrafish pit1 starts to be expressed at a much
              earlier stage of adenohypophysis development. However, as in the
              mouse, expression is restricted to a subset of pituitary cell
              types, excluding proopiomelanocortin (pomc)-expressing cells
              (corticotropes, melanotropes) and possibly gonadotropes. We could
              identify two N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced zebrafish pit1 null
              mutants. Most mutants die during larval stages, whereas survivors
              develop severe dwarfism. Mutant larvae lack lactotropes,
              somatotropes, and thyrotropes, although the adenohypophysis is of
              normal size, without any sign of increased apoptosis rates.
              Instead, mutant embryos initiate ectopic expression of pomc in
              pit1-positive cells, leading to an expansion of the Pomc lineage.
              Similarly, the number of gonadotropes seems increased, as
              indicated by the expression of gsualpha, a marker for thyrotropes
              and gonadotropes. In pit1 mutants, the total number of
              gsualpha-positive cells is normal despite the loss of gsualpha
              and tshbeta coexpressing cells. Together, these data suggest a
              transfating of the Pit1 lineage to the Pomc and possibly the
              gonadotroph lineages in the mutant, and a pomc- and
              gonadotropin-repressive role of Pit1 during normal zebrafish
              development. This is different from mouse, for which a repressive
              role of Pit-1 has only been reported for the gonadotropin Lhbeta,
              but not for Pomc. In sum, our data point to both conserved and

              calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) and the extracellular

              Ca(2+)-dependent ``cross-talk'' between these two protein kinase
              families. Using a combination of pharmacological inhibitors and
              dominant-negative kinases (dnKinase), we identified a requirement
              for CaMKK acting through CaMKI in the stimulation of ERKs upon
              depolarization of the neuroblastoma cell line, NG108.
              Depolarization stimulated prolonged ERK and JNK activation that
              was blocked by the CaMKK inhibitor, STO-609; this inhibition of
              ERK activation by STO-609 was rescued by expression of a
              STO-609-insensitive mutant of CaMKK. However, activation of ERK
              by epidermal growth factor or carbachol were not suppressed by
              inhibition of CaMKK, indicating specificity for this
              ``cross-talk.'' To identify the downstream target of CaMKK that
              mediated ERK activation upon depolarization, dnKinases were
              expressed. The dnCaMKI completely suppressed ERK2 activation
              whereas dnAKT/PKB or nuclear-targeted dnCaMKIV, other substrates

              CaMKI was blocked by dnRas. Additionally, depolarization of NG108
              cells promoted neurite outgrowth, and this effect was blocked by
              inhibition of either CaMKK (STO-609) or ERK (UO126).
              Co-transfection with caCaMKK plus caCaMKI also stimulated neurite
              outgrowth that was blocked by inhibition of ERK (UO126). These
              data are the first to suggest that ERK activation and neurite

  abstract = "Rodent seizure models have significantly contributed to our basic
              understanding of epilepsy. However, medically intractable forms
              of epilepsy persist and the fundamental mechanisms underlying
              this disease remain unclear. Here we show that seizures can be
              elicited in a simple vertebrate system e.g. zebrafish larvae
              (Danio rerio). Exposure to a common convulsant agent
              (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ) induced a stereotyped and
              concentration-dependent sequence of behavioral changes
              culminating in clonus-like convulsions. Extracellular recordings
              from fish optic tectum revealed ictal and interictal-like
              electrographic discharges after application of PTZ, which could
              be blocked by tetrodotoxin or glutamate receptor antagonists.
              Epileptiform discharges were suppressed by commonly used
              antiepileptic drugs, valproate and diazepam, in a
              concentration-dependent manner. Up-regulation of c-fos expression
              was also observed in CNS structures of zebrafish exposed to PTZ.
              Taken together, these results demonstrate that chemically-induced
              seizures in zebrafish exhibit behavioral, electrographic, and
              molecular changes that would be expected from a rodent seizure
              model. Therefore, zebrafish larvae represent a powerful new

              in height and width as it undergoes convergent extension,
              increasing in length with the axis. The adenohypophysis is a

              which genes underlie this phenotype could shed light on the

              mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, because flies also sleep
              for many hours and, when sleep deprived, show sleep rebound and
              performance impairments. By screening 9,000 mutant lines, we

              so that it remains relatively constant over a wide range of
              temperatures (temperature compensation). In vertebrates, the
              molecular basis of these properties is poorly understood. Here,
              using the zebrafish as an ectothermic model, we demonstrate first
              that in the absence of light, exposure of embryos and primary
              cell lines to temperature cycles entrains circadian rhythms of
              clock gene expression. Temperature steps drive changes in the
              basal expression of certain clock genes in a gene-specific
              manner, a mechanism potentially contributing to entrainment. In
              the case of the per4 gene, while E-box promoter elements mediate
              circadian clock regulation, they do not direct the

              signaling functions to guide nascent olfactory axons to the OB

              olfactory placode during the initial phase of olfactory axon
              pathfinding. In the robo2 mutant, astray (ast), early growing

              understanding by using a forward genetic approach in zebrafish.
              Moving stimuli evoke two innate reflexes in zebrafish larvae, the
              optomotor and the optokinetic response, providing two rapid and
              quantitative tests to assess visual function in wild-type (WT)
              and mutant animals. These behavioral assays were used in a
              high-throughput screen, encompassing over half a million fish. In
              almost 2,000 F2 families mutagenized with ethylnitrosourea, we
              discovered 53 recessive mutations in 41 genes. These new
              mutations have generated a broad spectrum of phenotypes, which

              phototransduction, light adaptation, or behavior-specific
              responses. Almost all of the mutants are morphologically
              indistinguishable from WT, and many survive to adulthood. Genetic
              linkage mapping and initial molecular analyses show that our

              divide just once along the circumferential axis to produce two
              postmitotic daughters, one of which becomes a retinal ganglion
              cell (RGC). Interestingly, when these same progenitors are
              transplanted into a mutant environment lacking RGCs, they often
              divide along the central-peripheral axis and produce two RGCs.

              mechanical stimuli in the skin through their elaborately
              arborized peripheral axons. We investigated the developmental
              mechanisms that determine the size and shape of individual
              trigeminal arbors in zebrafish and analyzed how these
              interactions affect the functional organization of the peripheral
              sensory system. RESULTS: Time-lapse imaging indicated that direct
              repulsion between growing axons restricts arbor territories.
              Removal of one trigeminal ganglion allowed axons of the
              contralateral ganglion to cross the midline, and removal of both
              resulted in the expansion of spinal cord sensory neuron arbors.
              Generation of embryos with single, isolated sensory neurons
              resulted in axon arbors that possessed a vast capacity for growth
              and expanded to encompass the entire head. Embryos in which
              arbors were allowed to aberrantly cross the midline were unable
              to respond in a spatially appropriate way to mechanical stimuli.
              CONCLUSIONS: Direct repulsive interactions between developing
              trigeminal and spinal cord sensory axon arbors determine sensory
              neuron organization and control the shapes and sizes of
              individual arbors. This spatial organization is crucial for
              sensing the location of objects in the environment. Thus, a
              combination of undirected growth and mutual repulsion results in
              the formation of a functionally organized system of peripheral

              also contributes to the transient outward currents of cardiac
              myocytes. A-type currents in the dendrites of hippocampal CA1
              pyramidal neurons are regulated by activation of ERK/MAPK, and
              Kv4.2 is the likely pore-forming subunit of that current. We
              showed previously that Kv4.2 is directly phosphorylated at three
              sites by ERK/MAPK (T602, T607, and S616). In this study we
              determined whether direct phosphorylation of Kv4.2 by ERK/MAPK is
              responsible for the regulation of the A-type current observed in
              neurons. We made site-directed mutants, changing the phosphosite
              serine (S) or threonine (T) to aspartate (D) to mimic
              phosphorylation. We found that the T607D mutation mimicked the
              electrophysiological changes elicited by ERK/MAPK activation in
              neurons: a rightward shift of the activation curve and an overall
              reduction in current compared with wild type (WT). Surprisingly,
              the S616D mutation caused the opposite effect, a leftward shift
              in the activation voltage. K(+) channel-interacting protein
              (KChIP)3 ancillary subunit coexpression with Kv4.2 was necessary
              for the T607D effect, as the T607D mutant when expressed in the
              absence of KChIP3 was not different from WT Kv4.2. These data
              suggest that direct phosphorylation of Kv4.2 at T607 is involved
              in the dynamic regulation of the channel function by ERK/MAPK and
              an interaction of the primary subunit with KChIP is also
              necessary for this effect. Overall these studies provide new

              3-day-old zebrafish embryos after exposure to different
              photoperiodic regimes indicated that light is required for proper
              development of the circadian clock-controlled rhythmic expression
              of zfaanat2, and that a 1-h light pulse is sufficient to initiate
              this rhythm. Analysis of zper2 mRNA expression in zebrafish
              embryos exposed to different photoperiodic regimes indicated that
              zper2 expression is transiently up-regulated by light but is not
              regulated by the circadian oscillator. To establish the
              association between light-induced zper2 expression and
              light-induced clock-controlled zfaanat2 rhythm, zPer2 knock-down
              experiments were performed. The zfaanat2 mRNA rhythm, induced by
              a 1-h light pulse, was abolished in zPer2 knock-down embryos.

              immense medical importance, since dysfunction of this sensing
              machinery is suspected to be responsible for a significant
              proportion of human heart failure. In the hearts of the
              ethylnitros-urea (ENU)-induced, recessive embryonic lethal
              zebrafish heart failure mutant main squeeze (msq), we find
              stretch-responsive genes such as atrial natriuretic factor (anf)

              heart failure in msq mutants is due to a mutation in the

              costameres and sarcomeric Z-discs. The msq mutation (L308P)
              reduces ILK kinase activity and disrupts binding of ILK to the

              (PKB), and VEGF. Furthermore, antisense-mediated abrogation of

              expression of ANF and VEGF, the latter of which was recently

              5-lipoxygenase enzyme to generate the proinflammatory signal
              leukotriene C4 (LTC4). Here we report that Ca2+ entry through
              store-operated CRAC (Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+) channels
              activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs),
              members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, within
              minutes and this is necessary for stimulation of cPLA2. Ca2+
              entry activates ERK indirectly, via recruitment of Ca2+-dependent
              protein kinase C alpha and betaI. Ca2+ influx also promotes
              translocation of cytosolic 5-lipoxygenase to the nuclear
              membrane, a key step in the activation of this enzyme.
              Translocation is dependent on ERK activation. A role for gene
              activation is shown by the finding that CRAC channel opening
              results in increased transcription and translation of c-fos.
              Inhibition of ERK activation failed to prevent c-fos expression.
              Our results show that CRAC channel activation elicits short-term
              effects through the co-coordinated regulation of two metabolic
              pathways (cPLA2 and 5-lipoxygenase), which results in the
              generation of both intra- and intercellular messengers within
              minutes, as well as longer term changes involving gene
              activation. These short-term effects are mediated via ERK,
              whereas, paradoxically, c-fos expression is not. Ca2+ influx
              through CRAC channels can therefore activate different signaling

              this intact DNA transposon, activity that is mediated by the

              expression plasmid (pGW\_cfosEGFP). Purified recombinant DNAs are

              Yeast two-hybrid and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays
              indicated that the cytosolic Toll/IL-1R region of Toll-like
              receptor 4 (TLR4) (amino acids 739-769) is the responsible domain
              for interaction with the COOH terminal of Nox4 (amino acids
              451-530). Consistently, overexpression of the COOH-terminal
              region of Nox4 inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB activation in
              response to LPS. Downregulation of Nox4 by transfection of siRNA

  abstract = "The duration of intracellular signaling is thought to be a
              critical component in effecting specific biological responses.
              This paradigm is demonstrated by growth factor activation of the
              extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade in
              the rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12 cells). In this model,
              sustained ERK activation induced by nerve growth factor (NGF)
              results in differentiation, whereas transient ERK activation
              induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) results in proliferation
              in these cells. Recently, the immediate early gene product c-fos
              has been proposed to be a sensor for ERK signaling duration in
              fibroblasts. In this study, we ask whether this is true for NGF
              and EGF stimulation of PC12 cells. We show that NGF, but not EGF,
              can regulate both c-fos stability and activation in an
              ERK-dependent manner in PC12 cells. This is achieved through
              ERK-dependent phosphorylation of c-fos. Interestingly, distinct
              sites regulate enhanced stability and transactivation of c-fos.
              Phosphorylation of Thr325 and Thr331 are required for maximal
              NGF-dependent transactivation of c-fos. In addition, a consensus
              ERK binding site (DEF domain) is also required for c-fos
              transactivation. However, stability is controlled by
              ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Ser374, while phosphorylation of
              Ser362 can induce conformational changes in protein structure. We
              also provide evidence that sustained ERK activation is required
              for proper post-translational regulation of c-fos following NGF
              treatment of PC12 cells. Because these ERK-dependent
              phosphorylations are required for proper c-fos function, and
              occur sequentially, we propose that c-fos is a sensor for ERK
              signaling duration in the neuronal-like cell line PC12.",

              cost-effective vertebrate models to study the genetic regulation
              of sleep. The best characterized mammalian sleep/wake regulator

              medicines are available for treating stimulant addiction. We have
              advocated the idea of ``agonist therapy'' for cocaine dependence.
              This strategy involves administration of stimulant-like
              medications (e.g., monoamine releasers) to alleviate cocaine
              withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse. A chief limitation of
              this strategy is that many candidate medicines possess high abuse
              liability due to activation of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons
              in reward pathways. Evidence suggests that serotonin (5-HT)
              neurons can provide an inhibitory influence over mesolimbic DA
              neurons. Thus, it might be predicted that the balance between DA
              and 5-HT transmission is a critical variable when developing
              medications with reduced stimulant side effects. In this article,
              we review recent studies from our laboratory that examined
              neurochemical and behavioral effects of a series of monoamine
              releasers which displayed different potencies at DA and 5-HT
              transporters. The data show that increasing 5-HT release can
              attenuate stimulant effects mediated by DA release, such as motor
              stimulation and drug self-administration. Our findings support
              the work of others and indicate that elevated synaptic 5-HT can
              dampen certain behavioral effects of DA-releasing agents.
              Moreover, the relationship between DA and 5-HT releasing potency
              is an important determinant in developing new agonist medications

              photon microscopy. Using the upstream regulatory sequences from
              the nyx gene that encodes nyctalopin, we constructed a transgenic

              targeted yellow fluorescent protein (MYFP). Axonal terminals of
              these YFP-labeled bipolar cells laminated primarily in the inner

              isolated bipolar cells indicates that two or more subsets of

              Live imaging of YFP-expressing bipolar cells in the nyx::MYFP

              in mouse brains showed that QRFP is expressed exclusively in the

              receptor mRNAs are distinctly localized in various brain areas
              without an overlap to each other. When administered centrally in
              mice, QRFP induced feeding behavior, accompanied by increased
              general locomotor activity and metabolic rate. QRFP-induced food
              intake was abolished by preadministration of BIBP3226, a specific
              antagonist for the Y1 neuropeptide Y receptor. Hypothalamic
              prepro-QRFP mRNA expression was up-regulated upon fasting and in

              phosphorylation of both tyrosine and threonine residues by an
              activator kinase. To help define the role of these MAP kinases in
              neuronal signalling, we have used primary cultures derived from
              fetal rat cortex to assess the regulation of their activity by
              agonist stimulation of glutamate receptors and by synaptic
              activity. Regulation was assayed by monitoring changes in both
              tyrosine phosphorylation on western blots and in vitro kinase
              activity toward a selective MAP kinase substrate peptide. In
              initial studies, we found that phorbol ester treatment increased
              tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAP kinase and stimulated MAP
              kinase activity. A similar response was elicited by three
              agonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors, i.e.,
              trans-(+/-)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentane dicarboxylic acid,
              quisqualate, and (2S,3S,4S)-alpha-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine.
              MAP kinase activity and p42 MAP kinase tyrosine phosphorylation
              were also stimulated by the ionotropic glutamate receptor
              agonist, kainate, but not by N-methyl-D-aspartate. To examine
              regulation of MAP kinase by synaptic activity, cultures were
              treated with picrotoxin, an inhibitor of GABAA receptor-mediated
              inhibition that enhances spontaneous excitatory synaptic
              activity. Treatment of cultures with picrotoxin elicited
              activation of MAP kinase. This response was blocked by
              tetrodotoxin, which suppresses synaptic activity. These results
              demonstrate that p42 MAP kinase is activated by glutamate
              receptor agonist stimulation and by endogenous synaptic activity.",

              using intrinsic mechanisms. For example, cultured hippocampal
              neurons extend arbitrarily oriented neurites and then one of
              these, usually the one nearest the centrosome, begins to grow
              more quickly than the others. This neurite becomes the axon as it
              accumulates molecular components of the apical junctional
              complex. All the other neurites become dendrites. It is unclear,

              emergence. Mosaic analysis in four dimensions, using mutants in

              investigating many different aspects of vertebrate developmental
              biology. With the credentials of zebrafish as a developmental
              model now well recognized, the emerging new opportunity is the
              wider application of zebrafish biology to aspects of human
              disease modelling. This rapidly increasing use of zebrafish as a
              model for human disease has necessarily generated interest in the
              anatomy of later developmental phases such as the larval,
              juvenile, and adult stages, during which many of the key aspects
              of organ morphogenesis and maturation take place. Anatomical
              resources and references that encompass these stages are
              non-existent in zebrafish and there is therefore an urgent need
              to understand how different organ systems and anatomical
              structures develop throughout the life of the fish. RESULTS: To
              overcome this deficit we have utilized the technique of optical
              projection tomography to produce three-dimensional (3D) models of
              larval fish. In order to view and display these models we have

              contains more than 36,000 images of larval zebrafish, with more
              than 1,500 of these being annotated. The 3D models can be

              transmission, or gating of signals to motor systems. A
              quantitative and clinically important measure of sensorimotor
              gating is prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response,
              impairments in which have been demonstrated in several
              neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Here, we
              show for the first time that the acoustic startle response in

              an attractive vertebrate system in which to study this process.
              Here we describe a high-throughput system for quantifying the
              kinematics of motor events in zebrafish larvae in order to
              measure the initiation frequency of different maneuvers. We use
              this system to analyze responses to photic stimuli and find that
              larvae respond to changes in illumination with both acute
              responses and extended behavioral programs. Reductions in
              illumination elicit large angle turns, distinct from startle
              responses, which orient larvae toward the source of light. In
              continuing darkness, larvae are transiently hyperactive before

              microinfusion of a D1, but not a D2 receptor antagonist, blocks

              spatial learning, and deficits in early-stage hippocampal

              protein which acts in part as an inhibitory constraint on Ras
              signalling, and the deficits in early-stage LTP and spatial
              learning have been linked to Ras hyperactivation. However, the
              downstream targets of Ras hyperactivation that lead to cognitive
              disruption are unknown. The levels of activity of signalling
              molecules potentially downstream of Ras were therefore studied in
              NF1(+/-) mice. Elevated phospho-ERK (pERK) levels were observed

              (pAkt) and phospho-eIF4E (peIF4E) levels were unchanged relative

              reduced the hyperactive pERK levels in NF1(+/-) mice to the

              Ventral motor neurons and excitatory interneurons are

              are obtained. We are using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster
              to understand both types of regulation. With respect to circadian
              control, we have identified molecular mechanisms that are
              critical for the generation of a clock. Our recent efforts have
              focused on the analysis of posttranslational mechanisms,

              localization of circadian clock proteins period (PER) and
              timeless (TIM). Resetting the clock in response to light is also
              mediated through posttranslational events that target TIM for
              degradation by the proteasome pathway; a recently identified
              ubiquitin ligase, jet lag (JET), is required for this response.
              Our understanding of the homeostatic control of sleep is in its

              The immunoreactive NPR-A was localized in the capillaries of

              responding to stimuli sharing molecular features tend to be
              loosely clustered and thus establish a fractured chemotopic map.
              Neuronal circuits in the OB transform glomerular patterns of
              sensory input into spatiotemporal patterns of output activity and
              thereby extract information about a stimulus. It is, however,
              unknown whether the chemotopic spatial organization of glomerular
              inputs is maintained during these computations. To explore this
              issue, we measured spatiotemporal patterns of odor-evoked
              activity across thousands of individual neurons in the zebrafish
              OB by temporally deconvolved two-photon Ca(2+) imaging. Mitral
              cells and interneurons were distinguished by transgenic markers

              disappeared and activity patterns became more informative about
              precise odor identity. Hence, chemotopic maps of glomerular input
              activity are initially transmitted to OB outputs, but not
              maintained during pattern processing. Nevertheless, transient

              increased arousal threshold, and place preference. Rest

              mammals and similarly to birds, light suppresses sleep in

              a null mutation in the sole receptor for the wake-promoting

               Pharmacological manipulation of these receptors has differential
               effects on sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia. Here we
               show that sleep is regulated by GABA in Drosophila and that a
               mutant GABAA receptor, RdlA302S, specifically decreases sleep
               latency. The drug carbamazepine (CBZ) has the opposite effect on
               sleep; it increases sleep latency as well as decreasing sleep.
               Behavioral and physiological experiments indicated that RdlA302S
               mutant flies are resistant to the effects of CBZ on sleep
               latency and that mutant RDLA302S channels are resistant to the
               effects of CBZ on desensitization, respectively. These results

              species in which it has been carefully investigated, but what
              sleep is for remains a mystery. Sleep is also present in
              invertebrates, and an extensive analysis in Drosophila
              melanogaster has shown that sleep in fruit flies shows most of
              the fundamental features that characterize sleep in mammals. In
              Drosophila, sleep consists of sustained periods of quiescence
              associated with an increased arousal threshold. Fly sleep is
              modulated by several of the same stimulants and hypnotics that
              affect mammalian sleep. Moreover, like in mammals, fly sleep
              shows remarkable interindividual variability. The expression of
              several genes involved in energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity,
              and the response to cellular stress varies in Drosophila between
              sleep and wakefulness, and the same occurs in rodents. Brain
              activity also changes in flies as a function of behavioral state.
              Furthermore, Drosophila sleep is tightly regulated in a circadian
              and homeostatic manner, and the homeostatic regulation is largely
              independent of the circadian regulation. After sleep deprivation,
              recovery sleep in flies is longer in duration and more
              consolidated, indicated by an increase in arousal threshold and
              fewer brief awakenings. Finally, sleep deprivation in flies
              impairs vigilance and performance. Because of the extensive
              similarities between flies and mammals, Drosophila is now being
              used as a promising model system for the genetic dissection of
              sleep. Over the last few years, mutagenesis screens have isolated

              synergies has been described in substantial detail in lampreys
              and the cellular mechanisms have been identified. The initiation
              of locomotion, on the other hand, relies on supraspinal networks
              and the cellular mechanisms involved are only beginning to be
              understood. This review examines some of the findings relative to
              the neural mechanisms involved in the initiation of locomotion of
              lampreys. Locomotion can be elicited by sensory stimulation or by
              internal cues associated with fundamental needs of the animal
              such as food seeking, exploration, and mating. We have described
              mechanisms by which escape swimming is elicited in lampreys in
              response to mechanical skin stimulation. A rather simple neural
              connectivity is involved, including sensory and relay neurons, as
              well as the brainstem rhombencephalic reticulospinal cells, which
              act as command neurons. We have shown that reticulospinal cells
              have intrinsic membrane properties that allow them to transform a
              short duration sensory input into a long-lasting excitatory
              command that activates the spinal locomotor networks. These
              mechanisms constitute an important feature for the activation of
              escape swimming. Other sensory inputs can also elicit locomotion
              in lampreys. For instance, we have recently shown that olfactory
              signals evoke sustained depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons
              and chemical activation of the olfactory bulbs with local
              injections of glutamate induces fictive locomotion. The
              mechanisms by which internal cues initiate locomotion are less
              understood. Our research has focused on one particular locomotor
              center in the brainstem, the mesencephalic locomotor region
              (MLR). The MLR is believed to channel inputs from many brain
              regions to generate goal-directed locomotion. It activates
              reticulospinal cells to elicit locomotor output in a graded
              fashion contrary to escape locomotor bouts, which are
              all-or-none. MLR inputs to reticulospinal cells use both
              glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission; nicotinic receptors
              on reticulospinal cells are involved. MLR excitatory inputs to
              reticulospinal cells in the middle (MRRN) are larger than those
              in the posterior rhombencephalic reticular nucleus (PRRN).
              Moreover at low stimulation strength, reticulospinal cells in the
              MRRN are activated first, whereas those in the PRRN require
              stronger stimulation strengths. The output from the MLR on one
              side activates reticulospinal neurons on both sides in a highly
              symmetrical fashion. This could account for the symmetrical
              bilateral locomotor output evoked during unilateral stimulation
              of the MLR in all animal species tested to date. Interestingly,
              muscarinic receptor activation reduces sensory inputs to
              reticulospinal neurons and, under natural conditions, the
              activation of MLR cholinergic neurons will likely reduce sensory
              inflow. Moreover, exposing the brainstem to muscarinic agonists
              generates sustained recurring depolarizations in reticulospinal
              neurons through pre-reticular effects. Cells in the caudal half
              of the rhombencephalon appear to be involved and we propose that
              the activation of these muscarinoceptive cells could provide
              additional excitation to reticulospinal cells when the MLR is
              activated under natural conditions. One important question
              relates to sources of inputs to the MLR. We found that substance
              P excites the MLR, whereas GABA inputs tonically maintain the MLR
              inhibited and removal of this inhibition initiates locomotion.
              Other locomotor centers exist such as a region in the ventral
              thalamus projecting directly to reticulospinal cells. This
              region, referred to as the diencephalic locomotor region,
              receives inputs from several areas in the forebrain and is likely
              important for goal-directed locomotion. In summary, this review
              focuses on the most recent findings relative to initiation of
              lamprey locomotion in response to sensory and internal cues in
              lampreys.",

              it contributes to specific components of the mature dendrite
              pattern. Neurons interpret activity into the influx of calcium

              differential activity in cortical neurons. In response to
              depolarizing stimuli, ERK was active for less than an hour in

              hours. Further, neurons in which ERK activity was sustained,

  abstract = "Brainstem reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) serve as the major
              descending system in vertebrate sensorimotor integration. One of
              the paired RSNs in zebrafish, the Mauthner (M) cell, is thought
              to initiate fast escape from sudden noxious stimuli. Two other
              paired RSNs, morphologically homologous to the M-cell, are also
              suggested to play key roles in controlling fast escape. However,
              the relationship among activities of the M-cell and its homologs
              during fast escape and the sensory inputs that elicit escape via
              their activation are unclear. We have monitored hindbrain RSN
              activity simultaneously with tail flip movement during fast
              escape in zebrafish. Confocal calcium imaging of RSNs was
              performed on larvae rostrally embedded in agar but with their
              tails allowed to move freely. Application of a pulsed waterjet to
              the otic vesicle (OV) to activate acousticovestibular input
              elicited contralateral fast tail flips with short latency and an
              apparent Ca(2+) increase, reflecting a single action potential,
              in the ipsilateral M-cell (M-escape). Application of waterjet to
              head skin for tactile stimulation elicited fast escapes, but
              onset was delayed and the M-cell did not fire (non-M-escape).
              After eliminating either the M-cell or OV, only non-M-escape was
              initiated. Simultaneous high-speed confocal imaging of the M-cell
              and one of its homologs, MiD3cm, revealed complementary
              activation during fast escape: MiD3cm activity was low during
              M-escape but high during non-M-escape. These results suggest that
              M-cell firing is necessary for fast escape with short latency

              what are the molecular functions of sleep; why can wakefulness
              only be sustained for defined periods before there is behavioral
              impairment; what genes contribute to the individual differences
              in sleep and the response to sleep deprivation? Behavioral
              criteria to define sleep have facilitated identification of sleep
              states in a number of different model systems: Drosophila,
              zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Each system has unique
              strengths. Studies in these model systems are identifying
              conserved signaling mechanisms regulating sleep that are present
              in mammals. For example, the PKA-CREB signaling mechanism
              promotes wakefulness in Drosophila, mice, and C. elegans.
              Microarray studies indicate that genes whose expression is
              upregulated during sleep are involved in macromolecule
              biosynthesis (proteins, lipids [including cholesterol], heme).
              Thus, a key function of sleep is likely to be macromolecule
              synthesis. Moreover, in all species studied to date, there is
              upregulation of the molecular chaperone BiP with extended
              wakefulness. Sleep deprivation leads to cellular ER stress in
              brain and the unfolded protein response. Identification of genes

              response properties. It is still debated how fine-grained
              synaptic layering is established during development. Here we
              investigated two stratified areas of the zebrafish visual
              pathway, the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina and the
              neuropil of the optic tectum, and determined if activity is
              required for their organization. RESULTS: The IPL of 5-day-old
              zebrafish larvae is composed of at least nine sublaminae,
              comprising the connections between different types of amacrine,
              bipolar, and ganglion cells (ACs, BCs, GCs). These sublaminae
              were distinguished by their expression of cell type-specific
              transgenic fluorescent reporters and immunohistochemical markers,
              including protein kinase Cbeta (PKC), parvalbumin (Parv), zrf3,
              and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). In the tectum, four retinal
              input layers abut a laminated array of neurites of tectal cells,
              which differentially express PKC and Parv. We investigated

              can also follow axons that have gone before--pioneer axons.
              Pioneers have been studied extensively in simple systems, but the
              role of axon-axon interactions remains largely unexplored in
              large vertebrate axon tracts, where cohorts of identical axons
              could potentially use isotypic interactions to guide each other
              through multiple choice points. Furthermore, the relative
              importance of axon-axon interactions compared with
              axon-autonomous receptor function has not been assessed. Here, we
              test the role of axon-axon interactions in retinotectal
              development, by devising a technique to selectively remove or
              replace early-born retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We find that
              early RGCs are both necessary and sufficient for later axons to
              exit the eye. Furthermore, introducing misrouted axons by
              transplantation reveals that guidance from eye to tectum relies
              heavily on interactions between axons, including both
              pioneer-follower and community effects. We conclude that
              axon-axon interactions and ligand-receptor signaling have
              co-equal roles, cooperating to ensure the fidelity of axon
              guidance in developing vertebrate tracts.",

              Caenorhabditis elegans also has a quiescent behavioural state
              during a period called lethargus, which occurs before each of the

               was consistent with the results obtained in an experiment
               conducted at the protein level, which demonstrated that one kind
               of hatching enzyme, ZHE1, was able to be purified from the

               performed by a single enzyme, different from the finding that
               the medaka hatching enzyme is an enzyme system composed of two
               enzymes, medaka high choriolytic enzyme (MHCE) and medaka low
               choriolytic enzyme (MLCE), which cooperatively digest the egg

               ZP3, but not in the internal regions, such as the ZP domains.
               The digestion manner of ZHE1 appears to be highly analogous to
               that of MHCE, which partially digests the egg envelope and
               swells the envelope. The cross-species digestion using enzymes

               and MHCE cleaved the same sites of the egg envelope proteins of
               two species, suggesting that the substrate specificity of ZHE1
               is quite similar to that of MHCE. However, MLCE did not show
               such similarity. Because HCE and LCE are the result of gene

              for coordinated responses to internal and external events. One of
              the potential reasons for such changes is an age-dependent
              failure of the integrating systems, including the circadian
              clock. Here we demonstrate that aging in a diurnal vertebrate,
              zebrafish (Danio rerio), is associated with major but selective
              circadian alterations. By 3-5 years of age, zebrafish have
              reduced amplitude and increased fragmentation of entrained
              circadian rhythms of activity, with fast desynchronization of the
              rhythms in the absence of environmental time cues. Aging in
              zebrafish is also associated with a reduction in the overall
              duration of nighttime sleep, followed by lower activity levels
              and a higher arousal threshold during the day. The production of
              the principal circadian hormone, melatonin, progressively
              declines during zebrafish aging. However, the ability of
              melatonin to acutely promote sleep and entrain circadian rhythms
              of activity remains robust until at least 4-5 years of age,
              consistent with the preserved levels of mRNA expression for
              melatonin receptors. Aged zebrafish have altered expression of
              the circadian genes zBmal1 and zPer1 but not zClock1. A lack of
              circadian time cues alters cognitive performance in aged more
              than in young zebrafish and this can be partially attenuated by
              daily melatonin administration. The advantages of zebrafish as a
              diurnal, small, prolific and genetically well-characterized
              vertebrate model provide new opportunities to clarify the
              intrinsic circadian factors involved in human aging and promote

  abstract = "During development, Met signaling regulates a range of cellular
              processes including growth, differentiation, survival and

              is activated by Hgf (hepatocyte growth factor) ligand. Altered
              regulation of human MET expression has been implicated in autism.
              In mouse, Met signaling has been shown to regulate cerebellum
              development. Since abnormalities in cerebellar structure have
              been reported in some autistic patients, we have used the
              zebrafish to address the role of Met signaling during cerebellar
              development and thus further our understanding of the molecular
              basis of autism. We find that zebrafish met is expressed in the
              cerebellar primordium, later localizing to the ventricular zone
              (VZ), with the hgf1 and hgf2 ligand genes expressed in
              surrounding tissues. Morpholino knockdown of either Met or its
              Hgf ligands leads to a significant reduction in the size of the
              cerebellum, primarily as a consequence of reduced proliferation.
              Met signaling knockdown disrupts specification of VZ-derived cell
              types, and also reduces granule cell numbers, due to an early
              effect on cerebellar proliferation and/or as an indirect
              consequence of loss of signals from VZ-derived cells later in
              development. These patterning defects preclude analysis of
              cerebellar neuronal migration, but we have found that Met
              signaling is necessary for migration of hindbrain facial motor
              neurons. In summary, we have described roles for Met signaling in
              coordinating growth and cell type specification within the
              developing cerebellum, and in migration of hindbrain neurons.

              In 1990, C. elegans was first observed to show habituation to a
              non-localized mechanical tap. The parameters that govern this
              behavioral plasticity in C. elegans were subsequently

              available to C. elegans researchers that allow for relatively
              easy genetic manipulation. This has lead to a number of recent
              genetic studies that have begun to identify key genes and
              molecules that play a role in the mechanisms of habituation. Some
              of these genes include a vesicular glutamate transporter, a

              neuron-to-motor neuron synapses in the defensive withdrawal
              circuit of Aplysia as a model system for analysis of molecular
              mechanisms of sensory gating and habituation. We address the
              following topics: 1. Of various possible mechanisms that might
              underlie depression at these sensory neuron-to-motor neuron
              synapses in Aplysia, historically the most widely-accepted
              explanation has been depletion of the readily releasable pool of
              vesicles. Depletion is also believed to account for synaptic
              depression at long interstimulus intervals in a variety of other
              systems. 2. Multiple lines of evidence now indicate that vesicle
              depletion is not an important contributing mechanism to synaptic
              depression at Aplysia sensory neuron-to-motor neuron synapses.
              More generally, it appears that vesicle depletion does not
              contribute substantially to depression that occurs with those
              stimulus patterns that are typically used in studying behavioral
              habituation. 3. Recent evidence suggests that at these sensory
              neuron-to-motor neuron synapses in Aplysia, synaptic depression
              is mediated by an activity-dependent, but release-independent,
              switching of individual release sites to a silent state. This
              switching off of release sites is initiated by Ca2+ influx during
              individual action potentials. We discuss signaling proteins that
              may be regulated by Ca2+ during the silencing of release sites
              that underlies synaptic depression. 4. Bursts of 2-4 action
              potentials in presynaptic sensory neurons in Aplysia prevent the
              switching off of release sites via a mechanism called
              ``burst-dependent protection'' from synaptic depression. 5. This
              molecular switch may explain the sensory gating that allows
              animals to discriminate which stimuli are innocuous and
              appropriate to ignore and which stimuli are more important and
              should continue to elicit responses.",

              evidence regarding the existence of habituation deficits in

              indicates that patients with schizophrenia display exaggerated
              startle sensitization and diminished habituation. Given the
              linkage between dopaminergic abnormalities and schizophrenia, the
              goal of the present investigation was to examine the effect of
              deleting D1 and D2-like dopamine receptors on sensitization and
              habituation of the acoustic startle reflex in mice. For these
              experiments, the acoustic startle reflex was assessed in dopamine
              D1, D2, and D3 receptor wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice on
              a C57BL/6J background, using a methodology that can measure both

              However, it remains unknown how this odor map is transferred from

              at single-cell resolution revealed that (1) individual MCs send
              axons to multiple target regions in the forebrain; (2) MCs
              innervating the same glomerulus do not necessarily display the
              same axon trajectory; (3) MCs innervating distinct glomerular
              clusters tend to project axons to different, but partly
              overlapping, target regions; (4) MCs innervating the medial
              glomerular cluster directly and asymmetrically send axons to the
              right habenula. We propose that the topographic odor map in the
              OB is not maintained intact, but reorganized in higher olfactory
              centers. Moreover, our finding of asymmetric bulbo-habenular
              projection renders the olfactory system an attractive model for
              the studies of brain asymmetry and lateralized behaviors.",

              require high-resolution imaging of large specimens in three
              dimensions (3D). Confocal microscopy produces high-resolution 3D
              images, but is limited by a relatively small field of view
              compared with the size of large biological specimens. Therefore,
              motorized stages that move the sample are used to create a tiled
              scan of the whole specimen. The physical coordinates provided by
              the microscope stage are not precise enough to allow direct
              reconstruction (Stitching) of the whole image from individual
              image stacks. RESULTS: To optimally stitch a large collection of
              3D confocal images, we developed a method that, based on the
              Fourier Shift Theorem, computes all possible translations between
              pairs of 3D images, yielding the best overlap in terms of the
              cross-correlation measure and subsequently finds the globally
              optimal configuration of the whole group of 3D images. This
              method avoids the propagation of errors by consecutive
              registration steps. Additionally, to compensate the brightness
              differences between tiles, we apply a smooth, non-linear
              intensity transition between the overlapping images. Our
              stitching approach is fast, works on 2D and 3D images, and for
              small image sets does not require prior knowledge about the tile
              configuration. AVAILABILITY: The implementation of this method is

              CoLos were present at one cell per hemi-segment.
              Electrophysiological recordings showed that an M-spike evoked a
              spike in CoLos via electrotonic transmission and that CoLos made
              monosynaptic inhibitory connections onto contralateral primary

              further showed that CoLos were active only during escapes. We
              examined the behavioral roles of CoLos by investigating escape
              behaviors in CoLo-ablated larvae. The results showed that the

              (ChR2) is a powerful tool for the optical induction of action
              potentials in neurons. Mutations of the cysteine 128 (C128)
              residue have been shown to greatly extend the lifetime of the
              conducting state of ChR2. However, until now, only subthreshold
              depolarizations have been reported from C128 mutants. METHODS AND
              FINDINGS: Here we report the induction of long high-frequency
              spike trains by brief light pulses in ChR2(C128A)-transfected
              pyramidal cells in hippocampal slice culture.
              ChR2(C128A)-mediated spike bursts triggered expression of the
              immediate early gene c-fos in pyramidal neurons. Robust and
              cell-specific expression of c-Fos protein was detected after a
              single blue light pulse and depended on action potential firing,
              but not on synaptic activity. However, photocurrents diminished
              upon repeated stimulation and limited the number of action

              selection that share traits with human insomnia. After 60
              generations, insomnia-like (ins-l) flies sleep 60 min a day,
              exhibit difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining

              flies are also hyperactive and hyperresponsive to environmental

              Such axonal spines are enriched with postsynaptic proteins,
              including ProSAP1/Shank2 and ionotropic and metabotropic
              glutamate receptors. In addition, immunofluorescence indicated

              investigation of substances at a biologically relevant level with
              respect to reward. Our lab has previously reported the
              development of a reliable conditioned place preference paradigm
              for zebrafish. Here, this test was used to isolate a dominant
              N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutant, no addiction
              (nad(dne3256)), which fails to respond to amphetamine, and which
              we used as an entry point towards identifying the behaviorally
              relevant transcriptional response to amphetamine. RESULTS:
              Through the combination of microarray experiments comparing the
              adult brain transcriptome of mutant and wild-type siblings under
              normal conditions, as well as their response to amphetamine, we
              identified genes that correlate with the mutants' altered
              conditioned place preference behavior. In addition to pathways
              classically involved in reward, this gene set shows a striking
              enrichment in transcription factor-encoding genes classically
              involved in brain development, which later appear to be re-used
              within the adult brain. We selected a subset of them for
              validation by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization,
              revealing that specific brain areas responding to the drug
              through these transcription factors include domains of ongoing
              adult neurogenesis. Finally, network construction revealed
              functional connections between several of these genes.

              neurons and a small subset of OPCs arise from common olig2(+)
              neuroepithelial precursors in rhombomeres r5 and r6, but that all
              other motor neurons and OPCs do not similarly develop from shared
              pools of olig2(+) precursors. In the absence of olig2 function,
              r5 and r6 precursors remain in the cell cycle and fail to produce
              abducens motor neurons, and OPCs are entirely lacking in the
              hindbrain. These studies, therefore, reveal both common and

              navigational behavior in vertebrates is hard to analyze, partly
              because underlying neural circuits are experience dependent.
              Phototaxis in zebrafish is a hardwired navigational behavior,
              performed at a stage when larvae swim by using a small repertoire
              of stereotyped movements. We established conditions to elicit
              robust phototaxis behavior and found that zebrafish larvae deploy
              directional orienting maneuvers and regulate forward swimming
              speed to navigate toward a target light. Using genetic analysis

              in brain structure or function. In Drosophila, the action of the
              male-specific isoform of fruitless in about 2000 neurons appears
              to be necessary and sufficient for many aspects of male courtship
              behavior. Initial work found limited evidence for anatomical
              dimorphism in these fru+ neurons. Subsequently, three discrete
              anatomical differences in central brain fru+ neurons have been
              reported, but the global organization of sex differences in
              wiring is unclear. RESULTS: A global search for structural
              differences in the Drosophila brain identified large volumetric
              differences between males and females, mostly in higher brain
              centers. In parallel, saturating clonal analysis of fru+ neurons
              using mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker identified
              62 neuroblast lineages that generate fru+ neurons in the brain.
              Coregistering images from male and female brains identified 19
              new dimorphisms in males; these are highly concentrated in
              male-enlarged higher brain centers. Seven dimorphic lineages also
              had female-specific arbors. In addition, at least 5 of 51 fru+
              lineages in the nerve cord are dimorphic. We use these data to
              predict >700 potential sites of dimorphic neural connectivity.
              These are particularly enriched in third-order olfactory neurons
              of the lateral horn, where we provide strong evidence for
              dimorphic anatomical connections by labeling partner neurons in
              different colors in the same brain. CONCLUSION: Our analysis
              reveals substantial differences in wiring and gross anatomy
              between male and female fly brains. Reciprocal connection

              The FOXO transcription factors, including the brain-enriched
              protein FOXO6, play a critical role in axo--dendritic
              polarization of undifferentiated neurites, and hence in a switch
              from unpolarized to polarized neuronal morphology. We also
              identify the gene encoding the protein kinase Pak1, which acts
              locally in neuronal processes to induce polarity, as a critical
              direct target gene of the FOXO transcription factors. Knockdown
              of endogenous Pak1 phenocopies the effect of FOXO knockdown on

              cell (RGC) axon arbor growth by promoting branch formation and by
              selectively stabilizing branches. To ask whether presynaptic
              function is required for this dual role of synapses, we have
              suppressed presynaptic function in single RGCs using targeted
              expression of tetanus toxin light-chain fused to enhanced green
              fluorescent protein (TeNT-Lc:EGFP). Time-lapse imaging of singly
              silenced axons as they arborize in the tectum of zebrafish larvae
              shows that presynaptic function is not required for stabilizing
              branches or for generating an arbor of appropriate complexity.
              However, synaptic activity does regulate two distinct aspects of
              arbor development. First, single silenced axons fail to arrest
              formation of highly dynamic but short-lived filopodia that are a
              feature of immature axons. Second, single silenced axons fail to
              arrest growth of established branches and so occupy significantly
              larger territories in the tectum than active axons. However, if
              activity-suppressed axons had neighbors that were also silent,
              axonal arbors appeared normal in size. A similar reversal in
              phenotype was observed when single TeNT-Lc:EGFP axons are grown
              in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801

              expansion of arbor territory is prevented when neighbors are
              silent, formation of transient filopodia is not. These results
              suggest that synaptic activity by itself regulates filopodia
              formation regardless of activity in neighboring cells but that
              the ability to arrest growth and focusing of axonal arbors in the
              target is an activity-dependent, competitive process.",

              experimental and theoretical analysis of neuronal circuits.
              Recent advances in optogenetics, high-resolution in vivo imaging,
              and reconstructions of synaptic wiring diagrams have created new
              opportunities to achieve this goal. To fully harness these
              methods, model organisms should allow for a combination of
              genetic and neurophysiological approaches in vivo. Moreover, the
              brain should be small in terms of neuron numbers and physical
              size. A promising vertebrate organism is the zebrafish because it
              is small, it is transparent at larval stages and it offers a wide
              range of genetic tools and advantages for neurophysiological
              approaches. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of

              four classes of cone rather than the normal three; and it has

              are indistinguishable to the normal trichromat. However, the

              provide an excellent model for genetic analysis of neuronal
              specification and axonal projections in vertebrates. Here, we

              and establish the basic scaffold of catecholaminergic

              axonal scaffold but establish their own tracts at defined
              ventrolateral positions. By using genetic tools, we study
              quantitative and qualitative contributions of noradrenergic and
              defined dopaminergic groups to the catecholaminergic scaffold.
              Suppression of Tfap2a activity allows us to eliminate
              noradrenergic contributions, and depletion of Otp activity
              deletes mammalian A11-like Otp-dependent ventral diencephalic

              tracts. In contrast, noradrenergic projections make only a minor
              contribution to hindbrain and spinal catecholaminergic tracts.

              even if this causes continued contact with painful stimuli [1,
              2]. In rodents, lesioning the habenula, an epithalamic structure
              that regulates the monoaminergic system, has been reported to
              reduce avoidance deficits caused by inescapable shock [3]. This
              is consistent with findings that inability to overcome a stressor
              is accompanied by an increase in serotonin levels [4]. However,
              other studies conclude that habenula lesions cause avoidance
              deficits [5, 6]. These contradictory results may be caused by
              lesions affecting unintended regions [6]. To clarify the role of
              the habenula, we used larval zebrafish, whose transparency and
              amenability to genetic manipulation enables more precise
              disruption of cells. We show that larval zebrafish learn to avoid
              a light that has been paired with a mild shock but fail to do so

              The difficulty of engineering light-sensitive proteins remains a

              accumulated in the nucleus to the same level as wild type (WT),

               larvae and adults are sleep-like states, as these rest bouts are

               Furthermore, zebrafish share with mammals a hypocretin/orexin

              physiological data available regarding its function. We report
              here that a distinct set of large, individually-identifiable

              were observed simultaneously with distinct swimming, turning and

              contralateral responses were at times observed in response to a

              illumination in vitro, resulting in damage to their plasma

              modification of this technique using a fluorescent microscope and
              membrane-tagged KR (mem-KR)-expressing transgenic zebrafish. We
              generated several stable zebrafish Tol2 transposon-mediated
              enhancer-trap (ET) transgenic lines expressing mem-KR (SqKR
              series), and mapped the transposon insertion sites. As mem-KR
              accumulates on the cell membrane and/or Golgi, it highlights cell
              bodies and extensions, and reveals details of cellular
              morphology. The photodynamic property of KR made it possible to
              damage cells expressing this protein in a dose-dependent manner.
              As a proof-of-principle, two zebrafish transgenic lines were used
              to affect cell viability and function: SqKR2 expresses mem-KR in
              the hindbrain rhombomeres 3 and 5, and elsewhere; SqKR15
              expresses mem-KR in the heart and elsewhere. Photobleaching of KR
              by intense light in the heart of SqKR15 embryos at lower levels
              caused a reduction in pumping efficiency of the heart and
              pericardial edema and at higher levels - in cell death in the
              hindbrain of SqKR2 and in the heart of SqKR15 embryos.

              affects cell viability and function in living zebrafish embryos.
              Hence, the zebrafish transgenics expressing mem-KR in a

              connectivity by measuring the level of co-activation of
              resting-state fMRI time-series between brain regions. These
              studies have revealed interesting new findings about the
              functional connections of specific brain regions and local
              networks, as well as important new insights in the overall
              organization of functional communication in the brain network.
              Here we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how
              they have led to new insights in core aspects of the human brain,
              providing an overview of these novel imaging techniques and their
              implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of spontaneous
              resting-state fMRI in determining functional connectivity,
              discuss suggested origins of these signals, how functional
              connections tend to be related to structural connections in the
              brain network and how functional brain communication may form a
              key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss
              the upcoming field of examining functional connectivity patterns
              using graph theory, focusing on the overall organization of the
              functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss the value

              and retinal tissue. Despite decades of research our knowledge of
              the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain (BBB) and
              blood-retinal (BRB) barrier is very limited. We have established
              an in vivo model to study the development and maintenance of
              these barriers by generating a transgenic zebrafish line that
              expresses a vitamin D-binding protein fused with enhanced green
              fluorescent protein (DBP-EGFP) in blood plasma, as an endogenous
              tracer. RESULTS: The temporal establishment of the BBB and BRB
              was examined using this transgenic line and the results were
              compared with that obtained by injection of fluorescent dyes into
              the sinus venosus of embryos at various stages of development. We
              also examined the expression of claudin-5, a component of tight
              junctions during the first 4 days of development. We observed
              that the BBB of zebrafish starts to develop by 3 dpf, with
              expression of claudin-5 in the central arteries preceding it at 2
              dpf. The hyaloid vasculature in the zebrafish retina develops a
              barrier function at 3 dpf, which endows the zebrafish with unique
              advantages for studying the BRB. CONCLUSION: Zebrafish embryos
              develop BBB and BRB function simultaneously by 3 dpf, which is
              regulated by tight junction proteins. The Tg(l-fabp:DBP-EGFP)

              in the environment and selects and executes the appropriate

              neuroscience. To facilitate the neuroethological study of
              visually guided behavior in larval zebrafish, we developed
              ``virtual reality'' assays in which precisely controlled visual
              cues can be presented to larvae whilst their behavior is
              automatically monitored using machine vision algorithms. Freely
              swimming larvae responded to moving stimuli in a size-dependent
              manner: they directed multiple low amplitude orienting turns
              (∼20°) toward small moving spots (1°) but reacted to larger spots
              (10°) with high-amplitude aversive turns (∼60°). The tracking of
              small spots led us to examine how larvae respond to prey during
              hunting routines. By analyzing movie sequences of larvae hunting
              paramecia, we discovered that all prey capture routines commence
              with eye convergence and larvae maintain their eyes in a highly
              converged position for the duration of the prey-tracking and
              capture swim phases. We adapted our virtual reality assay to
              deliver artificial visual cues to partially restrained larvae and

              of endogenous clocks, with a circadian pacemaker located in the
              suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus that
              synchronizes peripheral oscillators throughout the body. The
              molecular clock machinery is regulated by interlocked
              transcriptional translational feedback loops (TTLs). The core TTL
              includes the transcriptional modulators PER (1-3) and CRY (1/2)
              that feed back on their own expression by interaction with
              CLOCK/BMAL1. An accessory loop involving the transcription
              factors DEC1 and DEC2 has been described that also impinges on
              CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transactivation. In Drosophila, the DEC
              ortholog CWO shows synergistic activity to PER. This prompted the
              authors to analyze PER1-DEC interaction in the mammalian SCN.
              They generated Per1/Dec double and triple mutant mice to monitor
              activity rhythms under entrained and free-running conditions.
              Furthermore, they analyzed expression of the clock genes Per2,

              function for Per1 and Dec1/2 in period regulation was found,

              Luciferase reporter gene assays indicate an activatory function

              partially redundant and bidirectional regulatory function for the

              adult Drosophila brain into approximately 16,000 single neurons
              and reconstructed them into a common standardized framework to
              produce a virtual fly brain. We have constructed a mesoscopic map

              Despite individual local variation, the architecture of the

              neuropeptide PIGMENT DISPERSING FACTOR (PDF) in a circadian
              fashion. Electrical activity in the sLNvs is also required for
              behavioral rhythmicity. Yet, how temporal information is
              transduced into behavior remains unclear. RESULTS: Here we
              developed a new tool for temporal control of gene expression to
              obtain adult-restricted electrical silencing of the PDF circuit,
              which led to reversible behavioral arrhythmicity. Remarkably,
              PERIOD (PER) oscillations during the silenced phase remained
              unaltered, indicating that arrhythmicity is a direct consequence
              of the silenced activity. Accordingly, circadian axonal
              remodeling and PDF accumulation were severely affected during the
              silenced phase. CONCLUSIONS: Although electrical activity of the
              sLNvs is not a clock component, it coordinates circuit outputs
              leading to rhythmic behavior.",

  abstract = "Patterns of sleep vary widely among species, but the functional
              and evolutionary principles responsible for this diversity remain
              unknown. The characin fish, Astyanax mexicanus, has eyed surface
              and numerous blind cave populations. The cave populations are
              largely independent in their origins, and the species is ideal
              for studying the genetic bases of convergent evolution. Here we
              show that this system is also uniquely valuable for the
              investigation of variability in patterns of sleep. We find that a
              clearly defined change in ecological conditions, from surface to
              cave, is correlated with a dramatic reduction in sleep in three
              independently derived cave populations of A. mexicanus. Analyses
              of surface $\times$ cave hybrids show that the alleles for
              reduced sleep in the Pach{\'o}n and Tinaja cave populations are
              dominant in effect to the surface alleles. Genetic analysis of
              hybrids between surface and Pach{\'o}n cavefish suggests that
              only a small number of loci with dominant effects are involved.
              Our results demonstrate that sleep is an evolutionarily labile
              phenotype, highly responsive to changes in ecological conditions.

              hypotheses of fin function in larval zebrafish. Fins were active
              throughout bouts of slow swimming. Initiation was characterized
              by asymmetric fin abduction that transitioned to alternating
              rhythmic movement with first fin adduction. During subsequent
              swimming, fin beat amplitude decreased while tail beat amplitude
              increased over swimming speeds ranging from 1.47 to 4.56 body
              lengths per second. There was no change in fin or tail beat

              29.6$\pm$1.9 Hz, respectively). To examine potential roles of the
              pectoral fins in swimming, we compared the kinematics of finless
              larvae generated with a morpholino knockdown of the gene fgf24 to

              it caudally behind the fins, disrupting the boundary layer along
              the body's surface, a major site of oxygen absorption in larvae.

              long-term plasticity are accompanied by the rapid recruitment of
              synaptic components, which generally requires actin
              polymerization and may be one of the first steps in a program
              that can lead to the formation of new stable synapses during
              late-phase plasticity. However, most of those results come from
              studies of long-term potentiation in rodent hippocampus and might
              not generalize to other forms of synaptic plasticity or
              plasticity in other brain areas and species. For example,
              recruitment of presynaptic proteins during long-term facilitation
              by 5HT in Aplysia is delayed for several hours, suggesting that
              whereas activity-dependent forms of plasticity, such as long-term

              neuromodulatory forms of plasticity, such as facilitation by 5HT,
              involve more delayed recruitment. To begin to explore this
              hypothesis, we examined an activity-dependent form of plasticity,
              homosynaptic potentiation produced by tetanic stimulation of the

              including three types of horizontal and 28 types of amacrine

              for studying the molecular and physiological effects of nicotine
              exposure. The zebrafish have many advantageous physical
              characteristics, including small size, high fecundity rates, and
              externally developing transparent embryos. When combined with a
              battery of molecular-genetic tools and behavioral assays, these
              attributes enable studies to be conducted that are not practical
              using traditional animal models. METHODS: We reviewed the
              literature on the application of the zebrafish model as a
              preclinical model to study the biological effects of nicotine
              exposure. RESULTS: The identified studies used zebrafish to
              examine the effects of nicotine exposure on early development,
              addiction, anxiety, and learning. The methods used included green
              fluorescent protein-labeled proteins to track in vivo
              nicotine-altered neuron development, nicotine-conditioned place
              preference, and locomotive sensitization linked with
              high-throughput molecular and genetic screens and behavioral
              models of learning and stress response to nicotine. Data are
              presented on the complete homology of all known human neural
              nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in zebrafish and on the
              biological similarity of human and zebrafish dopaminergic

              problem worldwide. Further understanding of the molecular effects
              of nicotine exposure and genetic contributions to dependence may
              lead to improvement in patient treatment strategies. While there

              it should provide a valuable tool to complement existing model

              controlled by a network of circadian clocks, reset by inputs and
              delivering circadian signals to the brain and peripheral organs.
              In mammals, at the top of the network is a master clock located
              in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, mainly
              reset by ambient light. The nocturnal synthesis and release of
              melatonin by the pineal gland are tightly controlled by the SCN
              clock and inhibited by light exposure. Several roles of melatonin
              in the circadian system have been identified. As a major hormonal
              output, melatonin distributes temporal cues generated by the SCN
              to the multitude of tissue targets expressing melatonin
              receptors. In some target structures, like the Pars tuberalis of
              the adenohypophysis, these melatonin signals can drive daily
              rhythmicity that would otherwise be lacking. In other target
              structures, melatonin signals are used for the synchronization
              (i.e., adjustment of the timing of existing oscillations) of
              peripheral oscillators, such as the fetal adrenal gland. Due to
              the expression of melatonin receptors in the SCN, endogenous
              melatonin is also able to feedback onto the master clock,
              although its physiological significance needs further
              characterization. Of note, pharmacological treatment with
              exogenous melatonin can synchronize the SCN clock. From a
              clinical point of view, provided that the subject is not exposed
              to light at night, the daily profile of circulating melatonin
              provides a reliable estimate of the timing of the human SCN.
              During the past decade, a number of melatonin agonists have been
              developed for treating circadian, psychiatric and sleep
              disorders. These drugs may target the SCN for improving circadian
              timing or act indirectly at some downstream level of the
              circadian network to restore proper internal synchronization.",

  abstract = "In this study we report that larval zebrafish display adaptive
              locomotor output that can be driven by unexpected visual
              feedback. We develop a new assay that addresses visuomotor
              integration in restrained larval zebrafish. The assay involves a
              closed-loop environment in which the visual feedback a larva
              receives depends on its own motor output in a way that resembles
              freely swimming conditions. The experimenter can control the gain
              of this closed feedback loop, so that following a given motor
              output the larva experiences more or less visual feedback
              depending on whether the gain is high or low. We show that
              increases and decreases in this gain setting result in adaptive
              changes in behavior that lead to a generalized decrease or
              increase of motor output, respectively. Our behavioral analysis
              shows that both the duration and tail beat frequency of
              individual swim bouts can be modified, as well as the frequency
              with which bouts are elicited. These changes can be implemented
              rapidly, following an exposure to a new gain of just 175 ms. In
              addition, modifications in some behavioral parameters accumulate
              over tens of seconds and effects last for at least 30 s from
              trial to trial. These results suggest that larvae establish an
              internal representation of the visual feedback expected from a
              given motor output and that the behavioral modifications are
              driven by an error signal that arises from the discrepancy
              between this expectation and the actual visual feedback. The
              assay we develop presents a unique possibility for studying
              visuomotor integration using imaging techniques available in the
              larval zebrafish.",

              behavior exhibited by zebrafish early in development is a rapid

              However, sleep is a complex phenomenon characterized by several
              features including duration, intensity, and continuity. Sleep
              continuity is disrupted in different neurological and psychiatric
              conditions, many of which are accompanied by memory deficits.
              This finding has raised the question of whether the continuity of
              sleep is important for memory consolidation. However, current
              techniques used in sleep research cannot manipulate a single
              sleep feature while maintaining the others constant. Here, we
              introduce the use of optogenetics to investigate the role of
              sleep continuity in memory consolidation. We optogenetically
              targeted hypocretin/orexin neurons, which play a key role in
              arousal processes. We used optogenetics to activate these neurons
              at different intervals in behaving mice and were able to fragment
              sleep without affecting its overall amount or intensity.
              Fragmenting sleep after the learning phase of the novel object
              recognition (NOR) task significantly decreased the performance of
              mice on the subsequent day, but memory was unaffected if the
              average duration of sleep episodes was maintained at 62-73\% of
              normal. These findings demonstrate the use of optogenetic
              activation of arousal-related nuclei as a way to systematically
              manipulate a specific feature of sleep. We conclude that
              regardless of the total amount of sleep or sleep intensity, a
              minimal unit of uninterrupted sleep is crucial for memory

              short-fin zebrafish phenotype in the open tank after a
              short-period confinement into dark/bright environments. A total
              of 44 animals were individually confined during a 10-min single

              white-painted, and transparent cylinders (dark, bright, and

              tank test and their exploratory profile was recorded during a
              15-min trial. The results demonstrated that zebrafish increased
              their vertical exploratory activity during the first 6-min, where
              the bright group spent more time and travelled a higher distance
              in the top area. Interestingly, all behavioral parameters
              measured for the dark group were similar to the transparent one.
              These data were confirmed by automated analysis of track and
              occupancy plots and also demonstrated that zebrafish display a

              transduction and tracing in the adult zebrafish brain using
              GFP-encoding retro- and lentiviruses. The telencephalic germinal
              zone of the zebrafish comprises quiescent radial glial

              power of clonal viral vector-based analysis, we demonstrate that
              these progenitors follow different division modes and fates:
              neuroblasts primarily undergo a limited amplification phase
              followed by symmetric neurogenic divisions; by contrast, radial
              glia are capable at the single cell level of both self-renewing
              and generating different cell types, and hence exhibit bona fide
              neural stem cell (NSC) properties in vivo. We also show that

              divisions, which amplify this NSC pool and may account for its

              use, differentiating it from common stimulants; however, the

              Zebrafish, a low-cost, prolific, and genetically tractable animal
              model, have recently become a key model in sleep research.
              Zebrafish express circadian rhythms, sleep homeostasis, and sleep
              pressure, and, in addition, respond to common hypnotics and
              stimulants in a manner similar to mammals. Therefore, in the

              species representing 40-60 million years of evolution, with one
              of the conserved sequence motifs encompassing the yar promoter.
              Further, the timing of yar expression in Drosophila virilis

              transcriptional regulation of yar is conserved. The function of
              yar was defined by generating null alleles. Flies lacking yar

              Because this feature is tightly correlated with asymmetric

              activate the gene transcription machinery of the cell, calcium
              signals have to be conveyed from the site of their generation in

              in vitro assays, we have increased the dynamic range of GCaMP3 by
              severalfold, creating a family of ``GCaMP5'' sensors. We tested

              Signal-to-noise ratio was improved by at least 2- to 3-fold. In

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many organisms, from bacteria to human
              hunter-gatherers, use specialized random walk strategies to
              explore their environment. Such behaviors are an efficient
              stratagem for sampling the environment and usually consist of an
              alternation between straight runs and turns that redirect these
              runs. Drosophila larvae execute an exploratory routine of this
              kind that consists of sequences of straight crawls, pauses,
              turns, and redirected crawls. Central pattern generating networks
              underlying rhythmic movements are distributed along the
              anteroposterior axis of the nervous system. The way in which the
              operation of these networks is incorporated into extended
              behavioral routines such as substrate exploration has not yet
              been explored. In particular, the part played by the brain in
              dictating the sequence of movements required is unknown. RESULTS:
              We report the use of a genetic method to block synaptic activity
              acutely in the brain and subesophageal ganglia (SOG) of larvae
              during active exploratory behavior. We show that the brain and
              SOG are not required for the normal performance of an exploratory
              routine. Alternation between crawls and turns is an intrinsic
              property of the abdominal and/or thoracic networks. The brain
              modifies this autonomous routine during goal-directed movements
              such as those of chemotaxis. Nonetheless, light avoidance
              behavior can be mediated in the absence of brain activity solely
              by the sensorimotor system of the abdomen and thorax.
              CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of movements for substrate exploration
              is an autonomous capacity of the thoracic and abdominal nervous
              system. The brain modulates this exploratory routine in response
              to environmental cues.",

              more efficiently from an unexpected release site by acquiring
              navigational memory during the successful homing flight. This

              bees that were equipped with a radio frequency identification

              forced navigation tasks, but foraging flights of different
              lengths did not lead to different rest times during the day or

              interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem,
              hypothalamus, and basal forebrain converge onto common effector
              systems in the thalamus and cortex. Sleep results from the
              inhibition of wake-promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors
              such as adenosine and nitric oxide and GABAergic neurons in the
              preoptic area of the hypothalamus, resulting in large-amplitude,
              slow EEG oscillations. Local, activity-dependent factors modulate
              the amplitude and frequency of cortical slow oscillations.
              Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep results in conservation of
              brain energy and facilitates memory consolidation through the
              modulation of synaptic weights. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep
              results from the interaction of brain stem cholinergic,
              aminergic, and GABAergic neurons which control the activity of

              We have characterised a population of cells of the skin in
              developing zebrafish that resemble O(2)-chemoreceptive gill NECs.
              Skin NECs were identified by serotonin immunolabelling and were
              distributed over the entire skin surface. These cells contained
              synaptic vesicles and were associated with nerve fibres. Skin
              NECs were first evident in embryos 24-26 h post-fertilisation
              (h.p.f.), and embryos developed a behavioural response to hypoxia
              between 24 and 48 h.p.f. The total number of NECs declined with
              age from approximately 300 cells per larva at 3 days
              post-fertilisation (d.p.f.) to ~120 cells at 7 d.p.f., and were
              rarely observed in adults. Acclimation to hypoxia (30 mmHg) or

              hypoxia-acclimated larvae, the temporal pattern of skin NECs was
              altered such that the number of cells did not decrease with age.
              By contrast, hyperoxia produced a more rapid decline in NEC
              number. The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine degraded
              catecholaminergic nerve terminals that made contact with skin
              NECs and eliminated the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia.
              These results indicate that skin NECs are sensitive to changes in

              cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, is a model organism for the study
              of adaptive morphological and behavioral traits. In addition to
              loss of eyes and pigmentation, cave populations of A. mexicanus
              exhibit evolutionarily derived sleep loss and increased vibration

              cataplexy. Narcolepsy is caused by selective degeneration of

              neurons primarily regulate the sleep/wake cycle, feeding,

              zebrafish is implicated in both sleep and wake regulation. We
              established a transgenic zebrafish model enabling inducible
              ablation of HCRT neurons and used these animals to understand the
              function of HCRT neurons and narcolepsy. Loss of HCRT neurons
              increased the expression of the HCRT receptor (hcrtr). Behavioral

              experimental advantages that are making them a powerful model for
              these types of studies. While the majority of behavioural studies
              have focused on adult zebrafish, it has become apparent that
              larvae can also display complex stereotypical patterns of
              behaviour. Here we have used three compounds (pentylenetetrazole
              (PTZ), aconitine and 4-aminopyridine) that have different
              neuronal targets (GABA, sodium and potassium channels), to induce
              distinct patterns of hyperactivity in larvae. Our studies have
              revealed that each compound produces a number of distinct
              concentration-dependent activity patterns. This work has shown
              for the first time that at sub-convulsive concentrations, PTZ can
              reverse the normal behavioural response to alternating periods of
              light and dark in zebrafish larvae. It also appears that both PTZ
              and 4-aminopyridine produce distinct changes in the normal
              startle response patterns immediately following light/dark
              transitions that may be the result of an elevation in
              stress/anxiety. Aconitine produces a general elevation in
              activity that eliminates the normal response to light and dark.
              In addition to differences in the patterns of behaviour each
              compound also produces a unique pattern of c-fos (an immediate
              early gene) expression in the brain. While more work is required

              and individual behaviours, these models provide a framework with

              potentially de novo processing occurs in these recipient
              structures is a matter of great interest. Neurons in the larval

              In order to study this, we first used two-photon calcium imaging

              currents in the reverse temporal order. The membrane potential

  abstract = "Converging lines of evidence strongly support a role for sleep in
              brain plasticity. An elegant idea that may explain how sleep
              accomplishes this role is the ``synaptic homeostasis hypothesis
              (SHY).'' According to SHY, sleep promotes net synaptic weakening
              which offsets net synaptic strengthening that occurs during
              wakefulness. SHY is intuitively appealing because it relates the
              homeostatic regulation of sleep to an important function
              (synaptic plasticity). SHY has also received important
              experimental support from recent studies in Drosophila
              melanogaster. There remain, however, a number of unanswered
              questions about SHY. What is the cellular mechanism governing
              SHY? How does it fit with what we know about plasticity
              mechanisms in the brain? In this review, I discuss the evidence
              and theory of SHY in the context of what is known about Hebbian
              and non-Hebbian synaptic plasticity. I conclude that while SHY
              remains an elegant idea, the underlying mechanisms are mysterious
              and its functional significance unknown.",

              subdivisions of gymnotiform fish arise from the preglomerular
              complex. The preglomerular complex receives input from four
              clearly distinct regions: (1) descending input from the pallium
              itself (dorsomedial and dorsocentral subdivisions and nucleus
              taenia); (2) other diencephalic nuclei (centroposterior,
              glomerular, and anterior tuberal nuclei and nucleus of the
              posterior tuberculum); (3) mesencephalic sensory structures
              (optic tectum, dorsal and ventral torus semicircularis); and (4)
              basal forebrain, preoptic area, and hypothalamic nuclei. Previous
              studies have implicated the majority of the diencephalic and
              mesencephalic nuclei in electrosensory, visual, and
              acousticolateral functions. Here we discuss the implications of
              preglomerular/pallial electrosensory-associated afferents with
              respect to a major functional dichotomy of the electric sense.
              The results allow us to hypothesize that a functional distinction
              between electrocommunication vs. electrolocation is maintained
              within the input and output pathways of the gymnotiform pallium.
              Electrocommunication information is conveyed to the pallium
              through complex indirect pathways that originate in the nucleus
              electrosensorius, whereas electrolocation processing follows a
              conservative pathway inherent to all vertebrates, through the
              optic tectum. We hypothesize that cells responsive to
              communication signals do not converge onto the same targets in
              the preglomerular complex as cells responsive to moving objects.
              We also hypothesize that efferents from the dorsocentral (DC)
              telencephalon project to the dorsal torus semicircularis to
              regulate processing of electrocommunication signals, whereas DC
              efferents to the tectum modulate sensory control of movement.",

              S-phase in the epidermal cell layer of the fin under normal

              dark period. Remarkably, immediately following amputation the
              basal level of epidermal cell proliferation increases
              significantly with kinetics, depending upon the time of day when
              the amputation is performed. In sharp contrast, we failed to
              detect circadian rhythms of S-phase in the highly proliferative
              mesenchymal cells of the blastema. Subsequently, during the
              entire period of outgrowth of the new fin, elevated, cycling
              levels of epidermal cell proliferation persist. Thus, our results
              point to a preferential role for the circadian clock in the

              has been particularly effective in Drosophila melanogaster, where
              clonally related clusters of neurons derived from the same neural
              stem cell (neuroblast clones) are functionally related and
              morphologically highly stereotyped across animals. However
              identifying these neuroblast clones (approximately 180 per
              central brain hemisphere) manually remains challenging and time
              consuming. Here, we take advantage of the stereotyped nature of
              neural circuits in Drosophila to identify clones automatically,
              requiring manual annotation of only an initial, smaller set of

              We then measure how much information the presence of a cell body
              or projection at a particular location provides about the
              presence of each clone. This allows us to select a highly
              informative set of neuronal features as a template that can be
              used to detect the presence of clones in novel images. The

              Although studies in the neonatal murine spinal cord in vitro
              suggest an early locomotor role of the DDT, the function of the
              DDT in developing vertebrates in vivo remains unknown. Here, we
              investigated the role of the DDT in the locomotor development of
              zebrafish larvae. To assess the development of the behavioral and
              neural locomotor pattern, we used high-throughput video tracking
              in combination with peripheral nerve recordings. We found a
              behavioral and neural correspondence in the developmental switch
              from an immature to mature locomotor pattern. Blocking endogenous
              dopamine receptor 4 (D(4)R) signaling in vivo either before or
              after the developmental switch prevented or reversed the switch,
              respectively. Spinal transections of post-switch larvae
              reestablished the immature locomotor pattern, which was rescued
              to a mature-like pattern via spinal D(4)R agonism. Selective
              chemogenetic ablation of otp b (otpb) neurons that contribute to
              the DDT perpetuated the immature locomotor pattern in vivo. This
              phenotype was recapitulated by diencephalic transections that
              removed the dopaminergic otpb population and was rescued to a

              spinal D(4)R signaling to mediate the developmental switch to the

              of evolutionarily conserved clock genes are found in select
              pedigrees with extreme sleep timing, and there is suggestive
              evidence that certain common polymorphisms may be associated with
              self-reported day/night preference. However, no common
              polymorphism has been associated with the timing of directly
              observed human behavioral rhythms or other physiological markers
              of circadian timing at the population level. METHODS: We
              performed a candidate gene association study with replication,
              evaluating associations between polymorphisms in homologs of
              evolutionarily conserved clock genes and the timing of behavioral
              rhythms measured by actigraphy. For validated polymorphisms, we
              evaluated associations with transcript expression and time of
              death in additional cohorts. RESULTS: rs7221412, a common
              polymorphism near period homolog 1 (PER1), was associated with
              the timing of activity rhythms in both the discovery and
              replication cohorts (joint p = 2.1 $\times$ 10(-7) ). Mean
              activity timing was delayed by 67 minutes in rs7221412(GG) versus
              rs7221412(AA) homozygotes. rs7221412 also showed a suggestive
              time-dependent relationship with both cerebral cortex (p = 0.05)
              and CD14+ CD16- monocyte (p = 0.02) PER1 expression and an
              interesting association with time of death (p = 0.015) in which
              rs7221412(GG) individuals had a mean time of death nearly 7 hours

              behavioral rhythms, and shows evidence of association with time
              of death. This may be mediated by differential PER1 expression.

              the neuronal mechanisms through which volatile anesthetics act to
              produce unconsciousness remain obscure. One emerging possibility
              is that anesthetics exert their hypnotic effects by hijacking
              endogenous arousal circuits. A key sleep-promoting component of
              this circuitry is the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), a
              hypothalamic region containing both state-independent neurons and
              neurons that preferentially fire during natural sleep. RESULTS:
              Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry as a biomarker for antecedent
              neuronal activity, we show that isoflurane and halothane increase
              the number of active neurons in the VLPO, but only when mice are
              sedated or unconscious. Destroying VLPO neurons produces an acute
              resistance to isoflurane-induced hypnosis. Electrophysiological
              studies prove that the neurons depolarized by isoflurane belong
              to the subpopulation of VLPO neurons responsible for promoting
              natural sleep, whereas neighboring non-sleep-active VLPO neurons
              are unaffected by isoflurane. Finally, we show that this
              anesthetic-induced depolarization is not solely due to a
              presynaptic inhibition of wake-active neurons as previously
              hypothesized but rather is due to a direct postsynaptic effect on
              VLPO neurons themselves arising from the closing of a background

              demonstrates that anesthetics are capable of directly activating

              for example, which during the embryonic development of zebrafish
              form the thalamus proper appear largely conserved. Yet also
              striking differences between zebrafish and other vertebrates have
              been observed, particularly when we look at mature and
              histologically differentiated brains. A case in point is the
              migrated preglomerular complex of zebrafish which evolved only
              within the lineage of ray-finned fish and has no counterpart in
              mammals or tetrapod vertebrates. Based on its function as a
              sensory relay station with projections to pallial zones, the
              preglomerular complex has been compared to specific thalamic
              nuclei in mammals. However, no thalamic projections to the
              zebrafish dorsal pallium, which corresponds topologically to the
              mammalian isocortex, have been identified. Merely one teleostean
              thalamic nucleus proper, the auditory nucleus, projects to a part
              of the dorsal telencephalon, the pallial amygdala. Studies on
              patterning mechanisms identify a rostral and caudal domain in the
              embryonic thalamus proper. In both, teleosts and mammals, the
              rostral domain gives rise to GABAergic neurons, whereas
              glutamatergic neurons originate in the caudal domain of the
              zebrafish thalamus. The distribution of GABAergic derivatives in
              the adult zebrafish brain, furthermore, revealed previously
              overlooked thalamic nuclei and redefined already established
              ones. These findings require some reconsideration regarding the
              topological origin of these adult structures. In what follows, I
              discuss how evolutionary conserved and newly acquired features of
              the developing and adult zebrafish thalamus can be compared to
              the mammalian situation.",

              model for sleep homeostasis has yet to emerge. To better
              understand the function and regulation of sleep, we employed a

              disrupted sleep homeostat. Knockdown of the INC-interacting

              we have studied zebrafish V0 neurons, those that derive from the
              p0 progenitor domain, to address this question. We find that all
              V0 neurons have commissural axons, but they can be divided into
              excitatory and inhibitory classes. V0 excitatory neurons (V0-e)
              can be further categorized into three groups based on their
              axonal trajectories; V0-eA (ascending), V0-eB (bifurcating), and

  abstract = "One of the most commonly used behavioral endpoints measured in
              preclinical studies using rodent models is thigmotaxis (or
              ``wall-hugging''). Thigmotaxis is a well-validated index of
              anxiety in animals and humans. While assays measuring thigmotaxis
              in adult zebrafish have been developed, a thigmotaxis assay has
              not yet been validated in larval zebrafish. Here we present a
              novel assay for measurement of thigmotaxis in zebrafish larvae
              that is triggered by a sudden change in illumination (i.e. sudden
              light-to-darkness transition) and performed in a standard 24-well
              plate. We show that zebrafish larvae as young as 5 days post
              fertilization respond to this challenge by engaging in
              thigmotaxis. Thigmotaxis was significantly attenuated by
              anxiolytic (diazepam) and significantly enhanced by anxiogenic
              (caffeine) drugs, thus representing the first validated
              thigmotaxis assay for larval zebrafish. We also show that
              exposure to sudden darkness per se may represent an anxiogenic
              situation for larval zebrafish since less contrasting
              light-to-darkness transitions (achieved by lowering darkness
              degrees) significantly decreased thigmotaxis levels in a manner
              similar to what was achieved with diazepam. These findings
              suggest that stimuli such as exposure to sudden darkness could be
              used proficiently to trigger the expression of anxiety-like
              behaviors in laboratory settings. In sum, this is a versatile
              protocol allowing testing of both anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs

              neural circuits is a central goal of neuroscience. The best
              quantitative approach to analyzing connectome data is still
              unclear but graph theory has been used with success. We present a
              graph theoretical model of the posterior lateral line
              sensorimotor pathway in zebrafish. The model includes 2,616
              neurons and 167,114 synaptic connections. Model neurons represent
              known cell types in zebrafish larvae, and connections were set
              stochastically following rules based on biological literature.
              Thus, our model is a uniquely detailed computational
              representation of a vertebrate connectome. The connectome has low
              overall connection density, with 2.45\% of all possible
              connections, a value within the physiological range. We used
              graph theoretical tools to compare the zebrafish connectome graph
              to small-world, random and structured random graphs of the same
              size. For each type of graph, 100 randomly generated
              instantiations were considered. Degree distribution (the number
              of connections per neuron) varied more in the zebrafish graph
              than in same size graphs with less biological detail. There was
              high local clustering and a short average path length between
              nodes, implying a small-world structure similar to other neural
              connectomes and complex networks. The graph was found not to be
              scale-free, in agreement with some other neural connectomes. An
              experimental lesion was performed that targeted three model brain
              neurons, including the Mauthner neuron, known to control fast
              escape turns. The lesion decreased the number of short paths
              between sensory and motor neurons analogous to the behavioral
              effects of the same lesion in zebrafish. This model is expandable

              not previously been addressed. This is a critical issue, because
              calcium signaling may represent an essential mechanism through
              which astrocytes can modulate synaptic activity. In our study, we
              performed calcium imaging in awake head-restrained mice and found
              that three commonly used anesthetic combinations
              (ketamine/xylazine, isoflurane, and urethane) markedly suppressed

              transients that appeared to be associated with arousal in awake

              resistant to a local blockade of glutamatergic or purinergic

              electrically evoked elevations of intracellular Ca(2+)

              complete within 20 min, although NFATc4 remains phosphorylated
              and localized to the cytosol, only exhibiting nuclear
              localization following prolonged (1-3 h) depolarization. Knocking
              down NFATc3, but not NFATc4, strongly diminished NFAT-mediated

              serine-proline repeats is critical for determining the magnitude

              transient spinal cord ischemia activates small ubiquitin-like
              modifier (SUMO1-3) conjugation, a post-translational protein
              modification that protects neurons from ischemia-like conditions.
              METHODS: Mice were subjected to 8-12 min of spinal cord ischemia
              and 3-24 h of recovery using a newly developed experimental
              model. To characterize the model, activation of stress response
              pathways induced after spinal cord ischemia, previously observed
              in other experimental models, was verified by western blot
              analysis. Levels and subcellular localization of SUMO-conjugated
              proteins in spinal cords were evaluated by western blot analysis
              and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: Following
              transient spinal cord ischemia, stress responses were activated
              as indicated by increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic
              initiation factor 2 (eIF2$\alpha$), extracellular
              signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and Akt. SUMO1 conjugation was
              not altered, but a selective rise in levels of SUMO2/3-conjugated
              proteins occurred, peaking at 6 h reperfusion. The marked
              activation of SUMO2/3 conjugation was a neuronal response to
              ischemia, as indicated by co-localization with the neuronal
              marker NeuN, and was associated with nuclear accumulation of
              SUMO2/3-conjugated proteins. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that
              spinal cord neurons respond to ischemic stress by activation of
              SUMO2/3 conjugation. Many of the identified SUMO target proteins
              are transcription factors and other nuclear proteins involved in
              gene expression and genome stability. It is therefore concluded
              that the post-ischemic activation of SUMO2/3 conjugation may
              define the fate of neurons exposed to a transient interruption of
              blood supply, and that this pathway could be a therapeutic target
              to increase the resistance of spinal cord neurons to transient

              remains elusive. In this review, we consider one compelling
              candidate: brain plasticity associated with memory processing.
              Focusing largely on hippocampus-dependent memory in rodents and
              humans, we describe molecular, cellular, network, whole-brain and
              behavioral evidence establishing a role for sleep both in
              preparation for initial memory encoding, and in the subsequent
              offline consolidation of memory. Sleep and sleep deprivation
              bidirectionally alter molecular signaling pathways that regulate
              synaptic strength and control plasticity-related gene
              transcription and protein translation. At the cellular level,
              sleep deprivation impairs cellular excitability necessary for
              inducing synaptic potentiation and accelerates the decay of
              long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, rapid eye
              movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep enhance
              previously induced synaptic potentiation, although synaptic
              de-potentiation during sleep has also been observed. Beyond
              single cell dynamics, large-scale cell ensembles express
              coordinated replay of prior learning-related firing patterns
              during subsequent NREM sleep. At the whole-brain level, somewhat
              analogous learning-associated hippocampal (re)activation during
              NREM sleep has been reported in humans. Moreover, the same
              cortical NREM oscillations associated with replay in rodents also
              promote human hippocampal memory consolidation, and this process
              can be manipulated using exogenous reactivation cues during
              sleep. Mirroring molecular findings in rodents, specific NREM
              sleep oscillations before encoding refresh human hippocampal
              learning capacity, while deprivation of sleep conversely impairs
              subsequent hippocampal activity and associated encoding.
              Together, these cross-descriptive level findings demonstrate that
              the unique neurobiology of sleep exerts powerful effects on
              molecular, cellular and network mechanisms of plasticity that
              govern both initial learning and subsequent long-term memory

              Spike-timing-dependent depression of open-eye-biased principal

              important for synaptic function through their trans-synaptic
              interaction with neurexins (NRXNs). The localization and synaptic
              effects of neuroligin-1 (NL-1, also called NLGN1) are specific to
              excitatory synapses with the capacity to enhance excitatory
              synapses dependent on synaptic activity or Ca(2+)/calmodulin
              kinase II (CaMKII). Here we report that CaMKII robustly
              phosphorylates the intracellular domain of NL-1. We show that
              T739 is the dominant CaMKII site on NL-1 and is phosphorylated in
              response to synaptic activity in cultured rodent neurons and
              sensory experience in vivo. Furthermore, a phosphodeficient
              mutant (NL-1 T739A) reduces the basal and activity-driven surface
              expression of NL-1, leading to a reduction in neuroligin-mediated
              excitatory synaptic potentiation. To the best of our knowledge,
              our results are the first to demonstrate a direct functional
              interaction between CaMKII and NL-1, two primary components of

              due to exceptionally complex neuroanatomy. This is exemplified by
              AGRP neurons, which are a molecularly defined population that is

              simulated the particle motion component of sound along the fish's
              dorsoventral axis. The thresholds to startle-inducing stimuli
              were determined in 5-6 d.p.f. zebrafish, and their hearing
              sensitivity was then characterized using the thresholds of
              prepulse tone stimuli (90-1200 Hz) that inhibited the acoustic
              startle response to a reliable startle stimulus (820 Hz at 20 dB

              and infants are transformed into the coordinated, flexible and
              adaptive movements of adults. In addressing this important issue,
              we consider a behavior that has been perennially viewed as a
              functionless by-product of a dreaming brain: the jerky limb
              movements called myoclonic twitches. Recent work has identified
              the neural mechanisms that produce twitching as well as those
              that convey sensory feedback from twitching limbs to the spinal
              cord and brain. In turn, these mechanistic insights have helped

              play in the self-organization of spinal and supraspinal
              sensorimotor circuits. Striking support for these ideas is coming
              from the field of developmental robotics: when twitches are
              mimicked in robot models of the musculoskeletal system, the basic
              neural circuitry undergoes self-organization. Mutually inspired
              biological and synthetic approaches promise not only to produce

              sensory input in order to track, approach, and catch the target.
              When using vision, the nervous system faces the problem of
              extracting relevant information from a continuous stream of input
              in order to detect and categorize visible objects as potential
              prey and to select appropriate motor patterns for approach. For
              prey capture, many vertebrates exhibit intermittent locomotion,
              in which discrete motor patterns are chained into a sequence,
              interrupted by short periods of rest. Here, using high-speed
              recordings of full-length prey capture sequences performed by
              freely swimming zebrafish larvae in the presence of a single
              paramecium, we provide a detailed kinematic analysis of first and
              subsequent swim bouts during prey capture. Using Fourier
              analysis, we show that individual swim bouts represent an
              elementary motor pattern. Changes in orientation are directed
              toward the target on a graded scale and are implemented by an
              asymmetric tail bend component superimposed on this basic motor
              pattern. To further investigate the role of visual feedback on
              the efficiency and speed of this complex behavior, we developed a
              closed-loop virtual reality setup in which minimally restrained
              larvae recapitulated interconnected swim patterns closely
              resembling those observed during prey capture in freely moving
              fish. Systematic variation of stimulus properties showed that
              prey capture is initiated within a narrow range of stimulus size
              and velocity. Furthermore, variations in the delay and location
              of swim triggered visual feedback showed that the reaction time
              of secondary and later swims is shorter for stimuli that appear
              within a narrow spatio-temporal window following a swim. This
              suggests that the larva may generate an expectation of stimulus
              position, which enables accelerated motor sequencing if the
              expectation is met by appropriate visual feedback.",

              hatching, at 72 h after fertilization, in configurations that
              resembled their mature organization. However, the cross-sectional
              area of these glomeruli increased throughout larval development,
              and they eventually comprised the largest units in postlarval
              olfactory bulbs. In contrast, small and anatomically

              apparently by segregating from five larger precursors that were

              underlying olfactory processing are well characterized in
              Drosophila, no studies to date have examined the encoding of odor
              identity by populations of neurons and related it to the odor
              specificity of olfactory behavior. Here we used two-photon Ca(2+)
              imaging to record odor-evoked responses from >100 neurons
              simultaneously in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB). For the
              first time, we demonstrate quantitatively that MB population
              responses contain substantial information on odor identity. Using
              a series of increasingly similar odor blends, we identified
              conditions in which odor discrimination is difficult
              behaviorally. We found that MB ensemble responses accounted well
              for olfactory acuity in this task. Kenyon cell ensembles with as
              few as 25 cells were sufficient to match behavioral
              discrimination accuracy. Using a generalization task, we
              demonstrated that the MB population code could predict the flies'
              responses to novel odors. The degree to which flies generalized a
              learned aversive association to unfamiliar test odors depended
              upon the relative similarity between the odors' evoked MB
              activity patterns. Discrimination and generalization place
              different demands on the animal, yet the flies' choices in these
              tasks were reliably predicted based on the amount of overlap
              between MB activity patterns. Therefore, these different

              During larval molts, C. elegans undergoes a period of profound
              behavioral quiescence termed lethargus. Locomotion quiescence
              during lethargus was abolished in mutants lacking a neuropeptide

              behavioral deficits including heightened susceptibility for
              alcoholism and addictive disorders. While a number of mechanisms
              have been proposed for how ethanol exposure disrupts brain
              development, with selective groups of neurons undergoing reduced
              proliferation, dysfunction and death, the induction of a new
              neurotransmitter phenotype by ethanol exposure has not yet been
              reported. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The effects of embryonic and larval
              ethanol exposure on brain development were visually monitored
              using transgenic zebrafish expressing cell-specific green
              fluorescent protein (GFP) marker genes. Specific subsets of
              GFP-expressing neurons were highly sensitive to ethanol exposure,
              but only during defined developmental windows. In the med12
              mutant, which affects the Mediator co-activator complex component
              Med12, exposure to lower concentrations of ethanol was sufficient
              to reduce GFP expression in transgenic embryos. In transgenic
              embryos and larva containing GFP driven by an oxytocin-like
              (oxtl) promoter, ethanol exposure dramatically up-regulated GFP
              expression in a small group of hindbrain neurons, while having no
              effect on expression in the neuroendocrine preoptic area.
              CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol exposure during limited embryonic periods
              impedes the development of specific, identifiable groups of
              neurons, and the med12 mutation sensitizes these neurons to the
              deleterious effects of ethanol. In contrast, ethanol exposure
              induces oxtl expression in the hindbrain, a finding with profound

              reward prediction error), but how they compute such signals is
              unknown. We recorded the activity of VTA neurons while mice
              associated different odour cues with appetitive and aversive
              outcomes. We found three types of neuron based on responses to
              odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type I,
              52\%) showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and
              rewards in a manner consistent with reward prediction error
              coding; the other half of neurons showed persistent activity
              during the delay between odour and outcome that was modulated
              positively (type II, 31\%) or negatively (type III, 18\%) by the
              value of outcomes. Whereas the activity of type I neurons was
              sensitive to actual outcomes (that is, when the reward was
              delivered as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly
              omitted), the activity of type II and type III neurons was
              determined predominantly by reward-predicting odours. We 'tagged'
              dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons with the light-sensitive
              protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their
              responses to optical stimulation while recording. All identified
              dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic neurons
              were of type II. These results show that VTA GABAergic neurons
              signal expected reward, a key variable for dopaminergic neurons
              to calculate reward prediction error.",

              and synaptic mechanisms within neocortical territories, although
              a role for the thalamus in this key physiological rhythm has been

              hormones in response to stress. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the

              aegypti have evolved a strong preference for humans, making them
              dangerously efficient vectors of malaria and Dengue haemorrhagic
              fever. Specific host odours probably drive this strong preference
              because other attractive cues, including body heat and exhaled
              carbon dioxide (CO2), are common to all warm-blooded hosts.
              Insects sense odours via several chemosensory receptor families,
              including the odorant receptors (ORs), membrane proteins that
              form heteromeric odour-gated ion channels comprising a variable
              ligand-selective subunit and an obligate co-receptor called Orco
              (ref. 6). Here we use zinc-finger nucleases to generate targeted
              mutations in the orco gene of A. aegypti to examine the
              contribution of Orco and the odorant receptor pathway to mosquito
              host selection and sensitivity to the insect repellent DEET
              (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). orco mutant olfactory sensory
              neurons have greatly reduced spontaneous activity and lack
              odour-evoked responses. Behaviourally, orco mutant mosquitoes
              have severely reduced attraction to honey, an odour cue related
              to floral nectar, and do not respond to human scent in the
              absence of CO2. However, in the presence of CO2, female orco
              mutant mosquitoes retain strong attraction to both human and
              animal hosts, but no longer strongly prefer humans. orco mutant
              females are attracted to human hosts even in the presence of
              DEET, but are repelled upon contact, indicating that olfactory-
              and contact-mediated effects of DEET are mechanistically
              distinct. We conclude that the odorant receptor pathway is
              crucial for an anthropophilic vector mosquito to discriminate

              similar to that of histones, and binds to methylated cytosines
              broadly across the genome. By phosphotryptic mapping, we identify
              three sites (S86, S274 and T308) of activity-dependent MeCP2
              phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of these sites is differentially
              induced by neuronal activity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
              or agents that elevate the intracellular level of 3',5'-cyclic
              AMP (cAMP), indicating that MeCP2 may function as an epigenetic
              regulator of gene expression that integrates diverse signals from
              the environment. Here we show that the phosphorylation of T308
              blocks the interaction of the repressor domain of MeCP2 with the
              nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) complex and suppresses the

              Consistent with this possibility, the mutation of MeCP2 T308A in

              and that RTT in humans may be due, in part, to the loss of
              activity-dependent MeCP2 T308 phosphorylation and a disruption of

              (NLG1) controls the activity and synaptic localization of
              N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which activity is impaired by
              prolonged wakefulness. We here highlight that this pathway may
              underlie both the adverse effects of sleep loss on cognition and
              the subsequent changes in cortical synchrony. We found that the
              expression of specific Nlg1 transcript variants is changed by
              sleep deprivation in three mouse strains. These observations were
              associated with strain-specific changes in synaptic NLG1 protein
              content. Importantly, we showed that Nlg1 knockout mice are not
              able to sustain wakefulness and spend more time in nonrapid eye

              modifications in waking quality as exemplified by low theta/alpha
              activity during wakefulness and poor preference for social
              novelty, as well as altered delta synchrony during sleep.
              Finally, we identified a transcriptional pathway that could
              underlie the sleep/wake-dependent changes in Nlg1 expression and
              that involves clock transcription factors. We thus suggest that

              However, technical limitations have prevented detailed study of
              the functional role of these neurons, a common problem for
              vertebrate organisms. Complexities involved in studies of

              examine the nervous system in freely moving animals to identify
              neurons that govern a specific behaviour, and then to repeatedly
              target and manipulate these neurons to characterize their
              function. Here we show neurons that generate the feeding motor
              program in Drosophila. We carried out an unbiased screen using
              remote neuronal activation and identified a critical pair of
              brain cells that induces the entire feeding sequence when
              activated. These 'feeding neurons' (here abbreviated to Fdg

              feeding behaviour and ablation of a single Fdg neuron distorts
              the sugar-induced feeding behaviour to become asymmetric,
              indicating the direct role of these neurons in shaping
              motor-program execution. Furthermore, recording neuronal activity

              compounds such as mustard oil. Phylogenetic analysis suggests
              that the single zebrafish ortholog of TRPV1/2 may have arisen
              from an evolutionary precursor of the mammalian TRPV1 and TRPV2.
              As opposed to TRPV2, mammalian TRPV1 is essential for
              environmentally relevant heat sensation. In the present study, we
              provide evidence that the zebrafish TRPV1 ion channel is also
              required for the sensation of heat. Contrary to development in
              mammals, zebrafish TRPV1(+) neurons arise during the first wave
              of somatosensory neuron development, suggesting a vital
              importance of thermal sensation in early larval survival. In
              vitro analysis showed that zebrafish TRPV1 acts as a molecular

              affected by these other drives and how this process is
              coordinated across the entire brain remains elusive.
              Neuromodulation is an important regulatory feature of many

  abstract = "The group of nuclei within the basal ganglia of the forebrain is
              central to the control of movement. We present data showing that
              the structure and function of the basal ganglia have been
              conserved throughout vertebrate evolution over some 560 million
              years. The interaction between the different nuclei within the
              basal ganglia is conserved as well as the cellular and synaptic
              properties and transmitters. We consider the role of the
              conserved basal ganglia circuitry for basic patterns of motor
              behaviour controlled via brainstem circuits. The output of the
              basal ganglia consists of tonically active GABAergic neurones,
              which target brainstem motor centres responsible for different
              patterns of behaviour, such as eye and locomotor movements,
              posture, and feeding. A prerequisite for activating or releasing
              a motor programme is that this GABAergic inhibition is
              temporarily reduced. This can be achieved through activation of
              GABAergic projection neurons from striatum, the input level of
              the basal ganglia, given an appropriate synaptic drive from
              cortex, thalamus and the dopamine system. The tonic inhibition of
              the motor centres at rest most likely serves to prevent the
              different motor programmes from becoming active when not
              intended. Striatal projection neurones are subdivided into one
              group with dopamine 1 receptors that provides increased
              excitability of the direct pathway that can initiate movements,
              while inhibitory dopamine 2 receptors are expressed on neurones

  abstract = "The Drosophila follicular epithelium, which surrounds developing
              egg chambers, is a well-established model for studying epithelial
              polarity because it is continuously generated from adult stem
              cells, making it easy to generate homozygous mutant clones in a
              heterozygous background. Mutant clones are usually marked by the
              loss of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expression, which
              distinguishes them from their green, wild-type neighbours. Here
              we report that damage to the epithelium during dissection can
              produce groups of GFP-negative cells that resemble mutant clones.
              Furthermore, several polarity factors, such as aPKC and Discs
              large, are not localised in these damage-induced false clones.
              This phenotype is identical to that reported for several mutants,
              including ampk and Dystroglycan mutant clones under conditions of
              energetic stress. Using more reliable systems to mark ampk and
              Dystroglycan null clones such as the MARCM system, we found that
              neither protein is required for epithelial polarity under low
              energy conditions. Thus, our previous report of a specific low
              energy polarity pathway is an artefact of the increased damage
              caused by dissecting the small ovaries of starved flies. However,
              ampk mutant cells are larger than normal under both starvation
              and well-fed conditions, indicating that AMPK restricts follicle
              cell growth even when dietary sugar is not limiting. We suspect
              that several other reports of mutants that disrupt follicle cell
              polarity may also be based on the phenotype of damage-induced
              false clones, and recommend the use of positively marked clones

               regulation, with different effects in human and rat. However,
               the function of NPF on sleep in Drosophila melanogaster has not
               yet been described. In this study, we investigated the effects
               of NPF and its receptor-neuropeptide F receptor (NPFR1) on
               Drosophila sleep. Male flies over-expressing NPF or NPFR1
               exhibited increased sleep during the nighttime. Further analysis
               demonstrated that sleep episode duration during nighttime was
               greatly increased and sleep latency was significantly reduced,
               indicating that NPF and NPFR1 promote sleep quality, and their
               action on sleep is not because of an impact of the NPF signal
               system on development. Moreover, the homeostatic regulation of
               flies after sleep deprivation was disrupted by altered NPF
               signaling, since sleep deprivation decreased transcription of
               NPF in control flies, and there were less sleep loss during
               sleep deprivation and less sleep gain after sleep deprivation in
               flies overexpressing NPF and NPFR1 than in control flies,
               suggesting that NPF system auto-regulation plays an important
               role in sleep homeostasis. However, these effects did not occur
               in females, suggesting a sex-dependent regulatory function in
               sleep for NPF and NPFR1. NPF in D1 brain neurons showed
               male-specific expression, providing the cellular locus for
               male-specific regulation of sleep by NPF and NPFR1. This study

              behavior remain unanswered. Recently, the zebrafish has emerged
              as a useful model organism for cerebellar studies, owing in part
              to the similarity in cerebellar circuits between zebrafish and
              mammals. While the cell types composing their cerebellar cortical
              circuits are generally conserved with mammals, zebrafish lack
              deep cerebellar nuclei, and instead a majority of cerebellar
              output comes from a single type of neuron: the eurydendroid cell.
              To describe spatial patterns of cerebellar output in zebrafish,
              we have used genetic techniques to label and trace eurydendroid
              cells individually and en masse. We have found that cerebellar
              output targets the thalamus and optic tectum, and have confirmed
              the presence of pre-synaptic terminals from eurydendroid cells in

              developed a detailed catalog of zebrafish behaviors (Zebrafish
              Behavior Catalog, ZBC) that covers both larval and adult models.

              a VR setup for rats, including software and large-scale

              rotation and walking in any direction. The entorhinal-hippocampal

              which is defined as orientation decisions based on comparisons of
              light intensity at successive moments in time. We developed a
              novel ``Virtual Circle'' assay where whole-field illumination is
              abruptly turned off when the fish swims out of a virtually
              defined circular border, and turned on again when it returns into
              the circle. The animal receives no direct spatial cues and
              experiences only whole-field temporal light changes. Remarkably,
              the fish spends most of its time within the invisible virtual
              border. Behavioral analyses of swim bouts in relation to light
              transitions were used to develop four discrete temporal
              algorithms that transform the binary visual input (uniform
              light/uniform darkness) into the observed spatial behavior. In
              these algorithms, the turning angle is dependent on the
              behavioral history immediately preceding individual turning
              events. Computer simulations show that the algorithms recapture
              most of the swim statistics of real fish. We discovered that

              the specific motor history preceding these turns. Several aspects

              activity, with cellular resolution, throughout the whole brains
              of zebrafish performing the optokinetic response. We found a
              sparse, broadly distributed network that has an elaborate but
              ordered pattern, with a bilaterally symmetrical organization.
              Activity patterns fell into distinct clusters reflecting sensory
              and motor processing. By correlating neuronal responses with an
              array of sensory and motor variables, we find that the network
              can be clearly divided into distinct functional modules.
              Comparing aligned data from multiple fish, we find that the
              spatiotemporal activity dynamics and functional organization are
              highly stereotyped across individuals. These experiments
              systematically reveal the functional architecture of neural

              extracellular glutamate, which induces depressive-like behaviors.
              We examined the activity of neurons in habenular pathways and

              interneurons to downstream partners in order to elicit a
              response. In the embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio), cutaneous
              Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory neurons fire in response to mechanical
              stimuli and excite downstream glutamatergic commissural primary
              ascending (CoPA) interneurons to produce a flexion response
              contralateral to the site of stimulus. In the absence of sensory
              stimuli, zebrafish spinal locomotor circuits are spontaneously
              active during development due to pacemaker activity resulting in
              repetitive coiling of the trunk. Self-generated movement must
              therefore be distinguishable from external stimuli in order to
              ensure the appropriate activation of touch reflexes. Here, we
              recorded from CoPAs during spontaneous and evoked fictive motor
              behaviors in order to examine how responses to self-movement are
              gated in sensory interneurons. During spontaneous coiling, CoPAs
              received glycinergic inputs coincident with contralateral
              flexions that shunted firing for the duration of the coiling
              event. Shunting inactivation of CoPAs was caused by a slowly
              deactivating chloride conductance that resulted in lowered
              membrane resistance and increased action potential threshold.
              During spontaneous burst swimming, which develops later, CoPAs
              received glycinergic inputs that arrived in phase with excitation
              to ipsilateral motoneurons and provided persistent shunting.
              During a touch stimulus, short latency glutamatergic inputs
              produced cationic currents through AMPA receptors that drove a
              single, large amplitude action potential in the CoPA before
              shunting inhibition began, providing a brief window for the
              activation of downstream neurons. We compared the properties of
              CoPAs to those of other spinal neurons and propose that
              glycinergic signaling onto CoPAs acts as a corollary discharge

              spatial resolutions improve, and large, publicly available data
              sets proliferate. Moreover, methodological improvements in the
              neuroimaging pipeline, such as non-linear spatial normalization,
              non-parametric permutation tests and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
              Carlo approaches, can dramatically increase the computational
              burden. Despite these challenges, there do not yet exist any fMRI
              software packages which leverage inexpensive and powerful
              graphics processing units (GPUs) to perform these analyses. Here,
              we therefore present BROCCOLI, a free software package written in
              OpenCL (Open Computing Language) that can be used for parallel
              analysis of fMRI data on a large variety of hardware
              configurations. BROCCOLI has, for example, been tested with an
              Intel CPU, an Nvidia GPU, and an AMD GPU. These tests show that
              parallel processing of fMRI data can lead to significantly faster
              analysis pipelines. This speedup can be achieved on relatively
              standard hardware, but further, dramatic speed improvements
              require only a modest investment in GPU hardware. BROCCOLI
              (running on a GPU) can perform non-linear spatial normalization
              to a 1 mm(3) brain template in 4-6 s, and run a second level
              permutation test with 10,000 permutations in about a minute.
              These non-parametric tests are generally more robust than their
              parametric counterparts, and can also enable more sophisticated
              analyses by estimating complicated null distributions.
              Additionally, BROCCOLI includes support for Bayesian first-level
              fMRI analysis using a Gibbs sampler. The new software is freely

              Rab4 and Rab5 involved in short-loop recycling regulate the

              that they control recycling locally. Dynamic image analysis

              regulation of physiology, behavior, and development. Translucent
              zebrafish embryos express extraretinal opsins early on, at a time
              when spontaneous activity in the developing CNS plays a role in
              neuronal maturation and circuit formation. Though the presence of
              extraretinal opsins is well documented, the function of direct

              parallel pathways. For example, in the mammalian retina, ~20
              types of retinal ganglion cells transmit information about the
              visual scene to the brain. The purpose of this profuse and early
              pathway splitting remains unknown. We examine a common instance
              of splitting into ON and OFF neurons excited by increments and
              decrements of light intensity in the visual scene, respectively.
              We test the hypothesis that pathway splitting enables more
              efficient encoding of sensory stimuli. Specifically, we compare a
              model system with an ON and an OFF neuron to one with two ON
              neurons. Surprisingly, the optimal ON-OFF system transmits the
              same information as the optimal ON-ON system, if one constrains
              the maximal firing rate of the neurons. However, the ON-OFF
              system uses fewer spikes on average to transmit this information.
              This superiority of the ON-OFF system is also observed when the
              two systems are optimized while constraining their mean firing
              rate. The efficiency gain for the ON-OFF split is comparable with
              that derived from decorrelation, a well known processing strategy
              of early sensory systems. The gain can be orders of magnitude
              larger when the ecologically important stimuli are rare but large
              events of either polarity. The ON-OFF system also provides a
              better code for extracting information by a linear downstream
              decoder. The results suggest that the evolution of ON-OFF
              diversification in sensory systems may be driven by the benefits

              Pharmacological studies have implicated certain neurotransmitter
              systems in social behavior, but circuit-level understanding of
              endogenous neural activity during social interaction is lacking.
              We therefore developed and applied a new methodology, termed
              fiber photometry, to optically record natural neural activity in
              genetically and connectivity-defined projections to elucidate the
              real-time role of specified pathways in mammalian behavior. Fiber
              photometry revealed that activity dynamics of a ventral tegmental
              area (VTA)-to-nucleus accumbens (NAc) projection could encode and
              predict key features of social, but not novel object,
              interaction. Consistent with this observation, optogenetic
              control of cells specifically contributing to this projection was
              sufficient to modulate social behavior, which was mediated by
              type 1 dopamine receptor signaling downstream in the NAc. Direct
              observation of deep projection-specific activity in this way

              about the transcriptional mechanisms that encode long-term

              relatively stimulus-specific and is thus encoded in small sets of
              neurons, providing poor signal/noise ratios for transcriptional
              analysis. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed a protocol
              for producing whole-body long-term habituation of the
              siphon-withdrawal reflex (SWR) of Aplysia californica.
              Specifically, we constructed a computer-controlled brushing
              apparatus to apply low-intensity tactile stimulation over the
              entire dorsal surface of Aplysia at regular intervals. We found
              that 3 d of training (10 rounds of stimulation/day; each round =
              15 min brushing at a 10-sec ISI; 15-min rest between rounds)
              produces habituation with several characteristics favorable for
              mechanistic investigation. First, habituation is widespread, with
              SWR durations reduced whether the reflex is evoked by tactile
              stimulation to the head, tail, or the siphon. Second, long-term
              habituation is sensitive to the pattern of training, occurring
              only when brushing sessions are spaced out over 3 d rather than
              massed into a single session. Using a custom-designed microarray
              and quantitative PCR, we show that long-term habituation produces
              long-term up-regulation of an apparent Aplysia homolog of
              cornichon, a protein important for glutamate receptor
              trafficking. Our training paradigm provides a promising starting

              variable-number-tandem-repeat polymorphism of the gene (DAT1,

              could be considered a simple model with which to investigate the

              the repertoire of pectoral fin movements by naturally behaving
              larvae at 5-6 days post-fertilization. Previously, two types of
              fin movements were characterized in association with locomotion:
              'CRAWLing,' an alternating fin movement associated with slow
              swimming, and 'TUCKing,' the adduction of both fins associated
              with fast swimming. We here describe a third mode of fin
              movement, which we call 'Munch's SCREAM', in which both pectoral
              fins were flipped anteriorly so that they reached the skin on the
              sides of the head, thus covering the otic vesicles. This behavior
              occurred spontaneously and was often associated with a slight
              regression or a sudden bending and change in body orientation. It
              could be also induced effectively in the agarose-embedded larvae
              by tactile stimulation on the skin around the eye and nose, some
              of which are associated with struggling, in which waves of
              bending propagate from the tail to the head. Larvae can still
              CRAWL and perform the SCREAM even when their forebrain and
              midbrain have been removed, suggesting that the neural circuits

              unilateral stimulation results in inappropriate bilateral motor

              experience-dependent fear. Therefore, understanding dHb function
              is important for understanding the neural basis of fear. In
              zebrafish, the dHb receives inputs from the mitral cells (MCs) of
              the olfactory bulb (OB), and odors can trigger distinct behaviors
              (e.g., feeding, courtship, alarm). However, it is unclear how the

              requires UV-sensing R7 photoreceptors and specific wide-field
              amacrine neurons called Dm8. Here we identify three types of
              medulla projection neurons downstream of R7 and Dm8 and show that
              selectively inactivating one of them (Tm5c) abolishes UV

              connections at the single-cell level, we reveal that each Dm8
              neuron forms multiple synaptic contacts with Tm5c in the center
              of Dm8's dendritic field but sparse connections in the periphery.
              By single-cell transcript profiling and RNAi-mediated knockdown,

              Pharmacological manipulations and receptor knockdown indicate

              changes in luminance to extract visual motion cues have been the
              focus of intense research. An influential model, the
              Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator, relies on differential temporal
              filtering of two spatially separated input channels, delaying one
              input signal with respect to the other. Motion in a particular
              direction causes these delayed and non-delayed luminance signals
              to arrive simultaneously at a subsequent processing step in the
              brain; these signals are then nonlinearly amplified to produce a
              direction-selective response. Recent work in Drosophila has
              identified two parallel pathways that selectively respond to
              either moving light or dark edges. Each of these pathways
              requires two critical processing steps to be applied to incoming
              signals: differential delay between the spatial input channels,
              and distinct processing of brightness increment and decrement
              signals. Here we demonstrate, using in vivo patch-clamp
              recordings, that four medulla neurons implement these two
              processing steps. The neurons Mi1 and Tm3 respond selectively to
              brightness increments, with the response of Mi1 delayed relative
              to Tm3. Conversely, Tm1 and Tm2 respond selectively to brightness
              decrements, with the response of Tm1 delayed compared with Tm2.
              Remarkably, constraining Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator models
              using these measurements produces outputs consistent with
              previously measured properties of motion detectors, including
              temporal frequency tuning and specificity for light versus dark
              edges. We propose that Mi1 and Tm3 perform critical processing of
              the delayed and non-delayed input channels of the correlator
              responsible for the detection of light edges, while Tm1 and Tm2
              play analogous roles in the detection of moving dark edges. Our
              data show that specific medulla neurons possess response
              properties that allow them to implement the algorithmic steps
              that precede the correlative operation in the
              Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator, revealing elements of the
              long-sought neural substrates of motion detection in the fly.",

              or be used in coordinated patterns with other legs, as in walking
              or climbing. While the control of walking has been extensively
              investigated, the mechanisms mediating the behavioral choice to
              activate individual legs independently are poorly understood. We
              examined this issue in stick insects, in which each leg can
              independently produce a rhythmic searching motor pattern if it
              doesn't find a foothold [1-4]. We show here that one non-spiking
              interneuron, I4, controls searching behavior in individual legs.
              One I4 is present in each hemi-segment of the three thoracic
              ganglia [5, 6]. Search-inducing sensory input depolarizes I4. I4
              activity was necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain
              searching movements. When substrate contact was provided, I4
              depolarization no longer induced searching. I4 therefore both
              integrates search-inducing sensory input and is gated out by
              other sensory input (substrate contact). Searching thus occurs
              only when it is behaviorally appropriate. I4 depolarization never
              elicited stepping. These data show that individual, locally
              activated neurons can mediate the behavioral choice to use
              individual legs independently. This mechanism may be particularly
              important in insects' front legs, which can function

              Neuroscience research with animal models, on the other hand,
              suggests that sleep facilitates retention by enhancing memory
              consolidation. Recently, in Drosophila, the ongoing activity of

              with locomotor activity and decreasing with rest. Increasing
              sleep-drive, with either the sleep-promoting agent Gaboxadol or
              by genetic stimulation of the neural circuit for sleep, decreases
              ongoing dopaminergic activity, while enhancing memory retention.
              Conversely, increasing arousal stimulates ongoing dopaminergic
              activity and accelerates dopaminergic-based forgetting.

              light inhibits pumping of the Caenorhabditis elegans pharynx, a

              circuits that alter pumping. First, light inhibits pumping via

              reconstruction of the anterior pharynx revealed evidence for
              synapses from I2 onto muscle that were missing from the published
              connectome, and we show that these ``missed synapses'' are likely
              functional. Second, light inhibits pumping through the RIP-I1-MC
              neuron polysynaptic circuit, in which an inhibitory signal is
              likely transmitted from outside the pharynx into the pharynx in a

              they do in mammals. Here we used calcium imaging to assess how
              the Kenyon cells in the fly mushroom bodies change their activity
              and reactivity to stimuli during sleep, wake, and after short or
              long sleep deprivation. As before, sleep was defined as a period

              up. Moreover, calcium transients in response to two different
              stimuli are larger in awake flies than in sleeping flies. The
              activity of Kenyon cells is also affected by sleep/wake history:
              in awake flies, more cells are spontaneously active and
              responding to stimuli if the last several hours (5-8 h) before

              well-being. Visual and non-visual photoreceptors are responsible
              for synchronizing circadian clocks to light, but clock-resetting
              is also achieved by alternating day and night temperatures with
              only 2-4 °C difference. This temperature sensitivity is
              remarkable considering that the circadian clock period (~24 h) is
              largely independent of surrounding ambient temperatures. Here we
              show that Drosophila Ionotropic Receptor 25a (IR25a) is required
              for behavioural synchronization to low-amplitude temperature
              cycles. This channel is expressed in sensory neurons of internal
              stretch receptors previously implicated in temperature
              synchronization of the circadian clock. IR25a is required for
              temperature-synchronized clock protein oscillations in subsets of
              central clock neurons. Extracellular leg nerve recordings reveal
              temperature- and IR25a-dependent sensory responses, and IR25a
              misexpression confers temperature-dependent firing of
              heterologous neurons. We propose that IR25a is part of an input
              pathway to the circadian clock that detects small temperature
              differences. This pathway operates in the absence of known 'hot'
              and 'cold' sensors in the Drosophila antenna, revealing the
              existence of novel periphery-to-brain temperature signalling
              channels.",

              synchronization of principal-neuron spiking activity is an
              effective mechanism for information coding that is regulated by
              GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid)-ergic interneurons through the
              generation of neuronal oscillations. Although neuronal synchrony
              has been demonstrated to be crucial for sensory, motor and

              of defined circuits involved in the control of emotional
              behaviour. Converging evidence indicates that fear behaviour is
              regulated by the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). This
              control over fear behaviour relies on the activation of specific
              prefrontal projections to the basolateral complex of the amygdala

              develop is based on studies of sensory systems, revealing often
              highly stereotyped patterns of connections, particularly as these
              diverge from the presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons. We
              know considerably less about the wiring strategies of motor
              networks, where connections converge onto the dendrites of
              motoneurons. Here, we investigated patterns of synaptic
              connections between identified motoneurons with sensory neurons
              and interneurons in the motor network of the Drosophila larva and
              how these change as it develops. RESULTS: We find that as animals
              grow, motoneurons increase the number of synapses with existing
              presynaptic partners. Different motoneurons form characteristic
              cell-type-specific patterns of connections. At the same time,
              there is considerable variability in the number of synapses
              formed on motoneuron dendrites, which contrasts with the
              stereotypy reported for presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons.
              Where two motoneurons of the same cell type contact a common
              interneuron partner, each postsynaptic cell can arrive at a
              different connectivity outcome. Experimentally changing the
              positioning of motoneuron dendrites shows that the geography of
              dendritic arbors in relation to presynaptic partner terminals is
              an important determinant in shaping patterns of connectivity.
              CONCLUSIONS: In the Drosophila larval motor network, the sets of
              connections that form between identified neurons manifest an
              unexpected level of variability. Synapse number and the
              likelihood of forming connections appear to be regulated on a

              properties, their downstream circuitry in the brain and thus
              their contribution to visual processing has remained unclear. In
              mice, several different types of DSGCs connect to the dorsal
              lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual thalamic structure
              that harbours cortical relay neurons. Whether direction-selective
              information computed at the level of the retina is routed to
              cortical circuits and integrated with other visual channels,
              however, is unknown. Here we show that there is a di-synaptic
              circuit linking DSGCs with the superficial layers of the primary
              visual cortex (V1) by using viral trans-synaptic circuit mapping
              and functional imaging of visually driven calcium signals in

              several types of DSGCs, converges in a specialized subdivision of
              the dLGN, and delivers direction-tuned and orientation-tuned
              signals to superficial V1. Notably, this circuit is anatomically
              segregated from the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway carrying
              non-direction-tuned visual information to deeper layers of V1,
              such as layer 4. Thus, the mouse harbours several functionally
              specialized, parallel retino-geniculo-cortical pathways, one of
              which originates with retinal DSGCs and delivers direction- and
              orientation-tuned information specifically to the superficial
              layers of the primary visual cortex. These data provide evidence
              that direction and orientation selectivity of some V1 neurons may

              connectivity of a class of GABAergic sensory neurons contacting
              the CSF in the vertebrate spinal cord and referred to as CSF-cNs.
              The remote activation of CSF-cNs was shown to trigger delayed

              exploration of age-dependent traits and diseases in vertebrates,

              provide an integrative genomic and genome-editing toolkit in this
              organism using our de-novo-assembled genome and the CRISPR/Cas9

              aging, and for a subset, we produce stable lines within 2-3

  abstract = "Although all sensory circuits ascend to higher brain areas where
              stimuli are represented in sparse, stimulus-specific activity
              patterns, relatively little is known about sensory coding on the
              descending side of neural circuits, as a network converges. In
              insects, mushroom bodies have been an important model system for
              studying sparse coding in the olfactory system, where this format
              is important for accurate memory formation. In Drosophila, it has
              recently been shown that the 2,000 Kenyon cells of the mushroom
              body converge onto a population of only 34 mushroom body output
              neurons (MBONs), which fall into 21 anatomically distinct cell
              types. Here we provide the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive
              view of olfactory representations at the fourth layer of the
              circuit, where we find a clear transition in the principles of
              sensory coding. We show that MBON tuning curves are highly
              correlated with one another. This is in sharp contrast to the
              process of progressive decorrelation of tuning in the earlier
              layers of the circuit. Instead, at the population level, odour
              representations are reformatted so that positive and negative
              correlations arise between representations of different odours.
              At the single-cell level, we show that uniquely identifiable
              MBONs display profoundly different tuning across different
              animals, but that tuning of the same neuron across the two
              hemispheres of an individual fly was nearly identical. Thus,
              individualized coordination of tuning arises at this level of the
              olfactory circuit. Furthermore, we find that this
              individualization is an active process that requires a
              learning-related gene, rutabaga. Ultimately, neural circuits have
              to flexibly map highly stimulus-specific information in sparse
              layers onto a limited number of different motor outputs. The
              reformatting of sensory representations we observe here may mark

              relationship to motor behavior remain unknown. RESULTS: By
              conducting electrophysiological recordings from awake, paralyzed
              zebrafish larvae that can produce behaviorally relevant activity
              patterns, we show that supraspinal DAergic neurons generate two
              forms of output: tonic spiking and phasic bursting. Using paired

              that these firing modes are associated with specific behavioral
              states. Tonic spiking is prevalent during periods of inactivity

              phenotypic defects, Vegfba, but not Vegfaa, mRNA was primarily

              Interestingly, in situ detection of Neuropilin1 (Nrp1) mRNA

              introduced into the egg by the sperm trigger progressive release
              of intracellular calcium stores in the oocyte. Calcium wave(s)
              spread through the oocyte and induce completion of meiosis, new
              macromolecular synthesis, and modification of the vitelline
              envelope to prevent polyspermy. However, arthropod eggs activate
              without fertilization: in the insects examined, eggs activate as
              they move through the female's reproductive tract. Here, we show
              that a calcium wave is, nevertheless, characteristic of egg
              activation in Drosophila. This calcium rise requires influx of
              calcium from the external environment and is induced as the egg
              is ovulated. Pressure on the oocyte (or swelling by the oocyte)

              waves also spread inward from oocyte pole(s). Wave propagation

              with very low-dose BPA (0.0068 $\mu$M, 1,000-fold lower than the
              accepted human daily exposure) and bisphenol S (BPS), a common

              specifically during the neurogenic window caused later

              interneurons form specific synapses on roughly 30 types of
              retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in a neuropil called the inner
              plexiform layer. Each RGC type extracts salient features from

              processing. The specificity and stereotypy of synapses formed in
              the inner plexiform layer account for the feature-detecting
              ability of RGCs. Here we analyse the development and function of
              synapses on one mouse RGC type, called the W3B-RGC. These cells
              have the remarkable property of responding when the timing of the
              movement of a small object differs from that of the background,
              but not when they coincide. Such cells, known as local edge
              detectors or object motion sensors, can distinguish moving

              W3B-RGCs receive strong and selective input from an unusual
              excitatory amacrine cell type known as VG3-AC (vesicular

              essential for visual responses of W3B-RGCs: whereas bipolar cells
              relay visual input directly to most RGCs, the W3B-RGCs receive
              much of their input indirectly, via the VG3-ACs. This
              non-canonical circuit introduces a delay into the pathway from
              photoreceptors in the centre of the receptive field to W3B-RGCs,

              have uncovered important principles in neurobiology that
              generalize to more complex vertebrate models [3]. The main
              excitatory input was thought to originate from multisensory
              afferents synapsing directly onto the M-cell dendrites [3]. Here,
              we describe an additional, convergent pathway that is essential
              for the M-cell-mediated startle behavior in larval zebrafish. It
              is composed of excitatory interneurons called spiral fiber
              neurons, which project to the M-cell axon hillock. By in vivo
              calcium imaging, we found that spiral fiber neurons are active in
              response to aversive stimuli capable of eliciting escapes. Like
              M-cell ablations, bilateral ablations of spiral fiber neurons
              largely eliminate short-latency escapes. Unilateral spiral fiber
              neuron ablations shift the directionality of escapes and indicate
              that spiral fiber neurons excite the M-cell in a lateralized
              manner. Their optogenetic activation increases the probability of
              short-latency escapes, supporting the notion that spiral fiber
              neurons help activate M-cell-mediated startle behavior. These
              results reveal that spiral fiber neurons are essential for the
              function of the M-cell in response to sensory cues and suggest
              that convergent excitatory inputs that differ in their input
              location and timing ensure reliable activation of the M-cell, a
              feedforward excitatory motif that may extend to other neural
              circuits.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Neural networks and their function are defined by
              synapses, which are adhesions specialized for intercellular
              communication that can be either chemical or electrical. At
              chemical synapses, transmission between neurons is mediated by
              neurotransmitters, whereas at electrical synapses, direct ionic
              and metabolic coupling occur via gap junctions between neurons.
              The molecular pathways required for electrical synaptogenesis are
              not well understood, and whether they share mechanisms of
              formation with chemical synapses is not clear. RESULTS: Here,
              using a forward genetic screen in zebrafish, we find that the
              autism-associated gene neurobeachin (nbea), which encodes a
              BEACH-domain-containing protein implicated in endomembrane
              trafficking, is required for both electrical and chemical synapse
              formation. Additionally, we find that nbea is dispensable for
              axonal formation and early dendritic outgrowth but is required to
              maintain dendritic complexity. These synaptic and morphological
              defects correlate with deficiencies in behavioral performance.
              Using chimeric animals in which individually identifiable neurons
              are either mutant or wild-type, we find that Nbea is necessary
              and sufficient autonomously in the postsynaptic neuron for both
              synapse formation and dendritic arborization. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              data identify a surprising link between electrical and chemical
              synapse formation and show that Nbea acts as a critical regulator
              in the postsynaptic neuron for the coordination of dendritic

  abstract = "Sensorimotor control in vertebrates relies on internal models.
              When extending an arm to reach for an object, the brain uses
              predictive models of both limb dynamics and target properties.
              Whether invertebrates use such models remains unclear. Here we
              examine to what extent prey interception by dragonflies
              (Plathemis lydia), a behaviour analogous to targeted reaching,
              requires internal models. By simultaneously tracking the position
              and orientation of a dragonfly's head and body during flight, we
              provide evidence that interception steering is driven by forward
              and inverse models of dragonfly body dynamics and by models of
              prey motion. Predictive rotations of the dragonfly's head
              continuously track the prey's angular position. The head-body
              angles established by prey tracking appear to guide systematic
              rotations of the dragonfly's body to align it with the prey's
              flight path. Model-driven control thus underlies the bulk of
              interception steering manoeuvres, while vision is used for

              diseases including addiction and mood and anxiety disorders.
              Using an animal model with both genetic diversity and large
              family size can help discover the specific genetic and
              environmental contributions to these behavioral diseases. The
              stress response has been studied extensively in teleosts because
              of their importance in food production. The zebrafish (Danio
              rerio) is a major model organism with a strong record for use in
              developmental biology, genetic screening, and genomic studies.
              More recently, the stress response of larval and adult zebrafish

              working memory (WM) impairments caused by sleep deprivation using
              fMRI-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
              Novel aspects of our fMRI-guided rTMS paradigm included the use
              of sophisticated covariance methods to identify functional
              networks in imaging data, and the use of fMRI-targeted rTMS
              concurrent with task performance to modulate plasticity effects
              over a longer term. DESIGN: Between-groups mixed model. SETTING:
              TMS, MRI, and sleep laboratory study. PARTICIPANTS: 27 subjects
              (13 receiving Active rTMS, and 14 Sham) completed the sleep
              deprivation protocol, with another 21 (10 Active, 11 Sham)
              non-sleep deprived subjects run in a second experiment.
              INTERVENTIONS: Our previous covariance analysis had identified a
              network, including occipital cortex, which demonstrated
              individual differences in resilience to the deleterious effects
              of sleep deprivation on WM performance. Five Hz rTMS was applied
              to left lateral occipital cortex while subjects performed a WM
              task during 4 sessions over the course of 2 days of total sleep
              deprivation. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At the end of the sleep
              deprivation period, Sham sleep deprived subjects exhibited
              degraded performance in the WM task. In contrast, those receiving
              Active rTMS did not show the slowing and lapsing typical in sleep
              deprivation, and instead performed similarly to non- sleep
              deprived subjects. Importantly, the Active sleep deprivation
              group showed rTMS-induced facilitation of WM performance a full
              18 hours after the last rTMS session. CONCLUSIONS: Over the
              course of sleep deprivation, these results indicate that rTMS
              applied concurrently with WM task performance affected neural
              circuitry involved in WM to prevent its full impact.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The best-studied arrangement of microtubules is that
              organized by the centrosome, a cloud of microtubule nucleating
              and anchoring proteins is clustered around centrioles. However,
              noncentrosomal microtubule arrays are common in many
              differentiated cells, including neurons. Although microtubules
              are not anchored at neuronal centrosomes, it remains unclear
              whether the centrosome plays a role in organizing neuronal
              microtubules. We use Drosophila as a model system to determine
              whether centrosomal microtubule nucleation is important in mature
              neurons. RESULTS: In developing and mature neurons, centrioles
              were not surrounded by the core nucleation protein
              $\gamma$-tubulin. This suggests that the centrioles do not
              organize functional centrosomes in Drosophila neurons in vivo.
              Consistent with this idea, centriole position was not correlated
              with a specific region of the cell body in neurons, and growing
              microtubules did not cluster around the centriole, even after
              axon severing when the number of growing plus ends is
              dramatically increased. To determine whether the centrosome was
              required for microtubule organization in mature neurons, we used
              two approaches. First, we used DSas-4 centriole duplication
              mutants. In these mutants, centrioles were present in many larval
              sensory neurons, but they were not fully functional. Despite
              reduced centriole function, microtubule orientation was normal in
              axons and dendrites. Second, we used laser ablation to eliminate
              the centriole, and again found that microtubule polarity in axons
              and dendrites was normal, even 3 days after treatment.
              CONCLUSION: We conclude that the centrosome is not a major site
              of microtubule nucleation in Drosophila neurons, and is not
              required for maintenance of neuronal microtubule organization in
              these cells.",

              become a valuable model for studying the development of
              left-right (L-R) asymmetry and its function in the vertebrate
              brain. The bilaterally paired dorsal habenulae exhibit striking
              differences in size, neuroanatomical organization, and molecular
              properties. They also display differences in their efferent
              connections with the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) and in their
              afferent input, with a subset of mitral cells distributed on both
              sides of the olfactory bulb innervating only the right habenula.
              Previous studies have implicated the dorsal habenulae in
              modulating fear/anxiety responses in juvenile and adult
              zebrafish. It has been suggested that the asymmetric
              olfactory-habenula pathway (OB-Ha), revealed by selective
              labeling from an lhx2a:YFP transgene, mediates fear behaviors
              elicited by alarm pheromone. Here we show that expression of the
              fam84b gene demarcates a unique region of the right habenula that
              is the site of innervation by lhx2a:YFP-labeled olfactory axons.
              Upon ablation of the parapineal, which normally promotes left
              habenular identity; the fam84b domain is present in both dorsal
              habenulae and lhx2a:YFP-labeled olfactory bulb neurons form
              synapses on the left and the right side. To explore the relevance
              of the asymmetric olfactory projection and how it might influence
              habenular function, we tested activation of this pathway using
              odorants known to evoke behaviors. We find that alarm substance
              or other aversive odors, and attractive cues, activate fos
              expression in subsets of cells in the olfactory bulb but not in
              the lhx2a:YFP expressing population. Moreover, neither alarm
              pheromone nor chondroitin sulfate elicited fos activation in the
              dorsal habenulae. The results indicate that L-R asymmetry of the
              epithalamus sets the directionality of olfactory innervation,
              however, the lhx2a:YFP OB-Ha pathway does not appear to mediate
              fear responses to aversive odorants.",

              habituation in any organism. To advance the goal of a
              comprehensive understanding of habituation, we have studied
              long-term habituation (LTH) of the gill-withdrawal reflex (GWR)
              in the marine snail Aplysia californica. Previously, we showed
              that habituation of the GWR in a reduced preparation lasts for up
              to 12 h, and depends on protein synthesis, as well as activation
              of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and postsynaptic glutamate
              receptors. Here, we have used the reduced preparation to further
              analyze the mechanisms of LTH in Aplysia. We found that LTH of
              the GWR depends on RNA synthesis because it was blocked by both
              the irreversible transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin-D and the
              reversible transcriptional inhibitor, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole
              riboside (DRB). In addition, LTH requires activation of protein
              phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), because it was disrupted by
              ascomycin. Finally, LTH was blocked by nitrendipine, which
              indicates that activation of l-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels
              is required for this form of learning. Together with our previous
              results, the present results indicate that exclusively
              presynaptic mechanisms, although possibly sufficient for
              short-term habituation, are insufficient for LTH. Rather, LTH
              must involve postsynaptic, as well as presynaptic, mechanisms.",

              episode, 34 medicated inpatients were examined with regard to
              sensitization and habituation effects in a trial-by-trial

              behavioral pattern that may reflect slower habituation to
              novelty. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic
              resonance imaging to examine habituation to neutral faces in 39
              young adults with either an extreme inhibited or extreme
              uninhibited temperament. Our investigation focused on two key
              brain regions involved in response to novelty--the amygdala and

              Individuals with an uninhibited temperament demonstrated

  abstract = "Despite having a small nervous system (302 neurons) and
              relatively short lifespan (14-21 days), the nematode
              Caenorhabditis elegans has a substantial ability to change its
              behavior in response to experience. The behavior discussed here
              is the tap withdrawal response, whereby the worm crawls backwards
              a brief distance in response to a non-localized mechanosensory
              stimulus from a tap to the side of the Petri plate within which
              it lives. The neural circuit that underlies this behavior is
              primarily made up of five sensory neurons and four pairs of
              interneurons. In this review we describe two classes of
              mechanosensory plasticity: adult learning and memory and
              experience dependent changes during development. As worms develop
              through young adult and adult stages there is a shift toward
              deeper habituation of response probability that is likely the
              result of changes in sensitivity to stimulus intensity. Adult
              worms show short- intermediate- and long-term habituation as well
              as context dependent habituation. Short-term habituation requires
              glutamate signaling and auto-phosphorylation of voltage-dependent
              potassium channels and is modulated by dopamine signaling in the
              mechanosensory neurons. Long-term memory (LTM) for habituation is
              mediated by down-regulation of expression of an AMPA-type
              glutamate receptor subunit. Intermediate memory involves an
              increase in release of an inhibitory neuropeptide. Depriving
              larval worms of mechanosensory stimulation early in development
              leads to fewer synaptic vesicles in the mechanosensory neurons
              and lower levels of an AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit in
              the interneurons. Overall, the mechanosensory system of C.
              elegans shows a great deal of experience dependent plasticity
              both during development and as an adult. The simplest form of
              learning, habituation, is not so simple and is mediated and/or
              modulated by a number of different processes, some of which we
              are beginning to understand.",

              However, distinguishing and following cells over extended time

              proteins (RFP, YFP and CFP) in neighboring cells, creating a

              using the Tol2 transposable element; namely, transgenesis, gene
              trapping, enhancer trapping and the Gal4FF-UAS system. Gene trap
              constructs contain a splice acceptor and the GFP or Gal4FF (a
              modified version of the yeast Gal4 transcription activator) gene,
              and enhancer trap constructs contain the zebrafish hsp70l
              promoter and the GFP or Gal4FF gene. By performing genetic
              screens using these constructs, we have generated transgenic
              zebrafish that express GFP and Gal4FF in specific cells, tissues
              and organs. Gal4FF expression is visualized by creating double
              transgenic fish carrying a Gal4FF transgene and the GFP reporter
              gene placed downstream of the Gal4-recognition sequence (UAS).
              Further, the Gal4FF-expressing cells can be manipulated by mating
              with UAS effector fish. For instance, when fish expressing Gal4FF
              in specific neurons are crossed with the UAS:TeTxLC fish carrying
              the tetanus neurotoxin gene downstream of UAS, the neuronal
              activities are inhibited in the double transgenic fish. Thus,
              these transgenic fish are useful to study developmental biology
              and neurobiology. DESCRIPTION: To increase the usefulness of the
              transgenic fish resource, we developed a web-based database named
              zTrap http://kawakami.lab.nig.ac.jp/ztrap/. The zTrap database
              contains images of GFP and Gal4FF expression patterns, and
              genomic DNA sequences surrounding the integration sites of the
              gene trap and enhancer trap constructs. The integration sites are
              mapped onto the Ensembl zebrafish genome by in-house Blat
              analysis and can be viewed on the zTrap and Ensembl genome
              browsers. Furthermore, zTrap is equipped with the functionality
              to search these data for expression patterns and genomic loci of
              interest. zTrap contains the information about transgenic fish
              including UAS reporter and effector fish. CONCLUSION: zTrap is a
              useful resource to find gene trap and enhancer trap fish lines
              that express GFP and Gal4FF in desired patterns, and to find
              insertions of the gene trap and enhancer trap constructs that are
              located within or near genes of interest. These transgenic fish
              can be utilized to observe specific cell types during
              embryogenesis, to manipulate their functions, and to discover
              novel genes and cis-regulatory elements. Therefore, zTrap should
              facilitate studies on genomics, developmental biology and
              neurobiology utilizing the transgenic zebrafish resource.",

              transgenic lines in live 6 day post fertilization larvae,

              and 20 transgenic lines that express fluorescent proteins in
              defined gene-specific patterns. Image stacks were acquired at
              single micron resolution, together with a broadly expressed
              neural marker, which we used to align enhancer trap reporter
              patterns into a common 3-dimensional reference space. To
              facilitate use of this resource, we have written software that
              enables searching for transgenic lines that label cells within a
              selectable 3-dimensional region of interest (ROI) or
              neuroanatomical area. This software also enables the
              intersectional expression of transgenes to be predicted, a
              feature which we validated by detecting cells with co-expression
              of Cre and Gal4. Many of the imaged enhancer trap lines show
              intrinsic brain-specific expression. However, to increase the
              utility of lines that also drive expression in non-neuronal
              tissue we have designed a novel UAS reporter, that suppresses
              expression in heart, muscle, and skin through the incorporation
              of microRNA binding sites in a synthetic 3' untranslated region.
              Finally, we mapped the site of transgene integration, thus
              providing molecular identification of the expression pattern for
              most lines. Cumulatively, this library of enhancer trap lines
              provides genetic access to 70\% of the larval brain and is
              therefore a powerful and broadly accessible tool for the
              dissection of neural circuits in larval zebrafish.",

              both isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67),

              retinal layers with photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion
              cells prominently labeled. Bipolar cells displayed the most
              intense glutamate-IR and bipolar cell axon terminals were clearly
              identified as puncta arranged in layers throughout the inner
              plexiform layer (IPL). These findings suggest the presence of
              multiple subtypes of presumed OFF- and ON-bipolar cells,
              including some ON-bipolar cells characterized by a single, large
              (9 microm X 6 microm) axon terminal. GABA-, GAD-, and glycine-IR
              were most intense in the inner retina. In general, the observed
              labeling patterns for GABA, GAD65, and GAD67 were similar. GABA-
              and GAD-IR were observed in a population of amacrine cells, a few
              cells in the ganglion cell layer, throughout the IPL, and in
              horizontal cells. In the IPL, both GABA- and GAD-IR structures
              were organized into two broad bands. Glycine-IR was observed in
              amacrine cells, interplexiform cells, and in both plexiform

              immunonegative region observed in sections stained for GAD and

              neurotransmitter. The observed distribution of neurotransmitters
              in the inner retina is consistent with previous studies of other

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The vertebrate retina is composed of five major types
              of neurons: three excitatory (photoreceptors, bipolar cells and
              ganglion cells) and two inhibitory (horizontal and amacrine
              cells). The transcription factor Ptf1a (pancreas transcription
              factor 1a) is important for the normal development of the
              inhibitory retinal neurons. RESULTS: Using a transgenic Ptf1a:GFP
              reporter and in situ hybridization in the zebrafish retina, we
              show that ptf1a message is transiently expressed in all amacrine
              and horizontal cells within hours after the terminal division of
              multipotent progenitors at the apical surface of the retinal
              neuroepithelium, and remains on as these cells migrate to their
              final laminar location. The message then shuts off, but we can
              follow the stable Ptf1a:GFP protein for up to 120 hours
              post-fertilization. A variety of anatomically and neurochemically
              distinct subtypes of amacrine cells can already be distinguished
              at this embryonic time point. CONCLUSION: The timing of Ptf1a
              expression suggests that it is involved in the very early stages
              or steps in the differentiation of amacrine cells, which, due to
              the perdurance of the Ptf1a:GFP, can be seen to rapidly diversify
              into a large number of subtypes. This work sets the stage for

              explored two complementary methods, viral gene delivery and the
              iTet-Off system, to express transgenes in the brain of zebrafish.
              High-level gene expression in neurons was achieved by Sindbis and
              Rabies viruses. The Tet system produced strong and specific gene
              expression that could be modulated conveniently by doxycycline.
              Moreover, transgenic lines showed expression in distinct, sparse
              and stable populations of neurons that appeared to be subsets of
              the neurons targeted by the promoter driving the Tet-activator.
              The Tet system therefore provides the opportunity to generate
              libraries of diverse expression patterns similar to gene trap
              approaches or the thy-1 promoter in mice, but with the additional
              possibility to pre-select cell types of interest. In transgenic
              lines expressing channelrhodopsin-2, action potential firing
              could be precisely controlled by two-photon stimulation at low

  abstract = "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the benchmark
              molecular markers for modern genomics. Until recently, relatively
              few SNPs were known in the zebrafish genome. The use of
              next-generation sequencing for the positional cloning of
              zebrafish mutations has increased the number of known SNP
              positions dramatically. Still, the identified SNP variants remain
              under-utilized, owing to scant annotation of strain specificity
              and allele frequency. To address these limitations, we surveyed
              SNP variation in three common laboratory zebrafish strains using
              whole-genome sequencing. This survey identified an average of
              5.04 million SNPs per strain compared with the Zv9 reference
              genome sequence. By comparing the three strains, 2.7 million
              variants were found to be strain specific, whereas the remaining
              variants were shared among all (2.3 million) or some of the
              strains. We also demonstrate the broad usefulness of our
              identified variants by validating most in independent populations
              of the same laboratory strains. We have made all of the
              identified SNPs accessible through 'SNPfisher', a searchable
              online database (snpfisher.nichd.nih.gov). The SNPfisher website
              includes the SNPfisher Variant Reporter tool, which provides the
              genomic position, alternate allele read frequency, strain
              specificity, restriction enzyme recognition site changes and
              flanking primers for all SNPs and Indels in a user-defined gene
              or region of the zebrafish genome. The SNPfisher site also
              contains links to display our SNP data in the UCSC genome

              transposable element and its application to the functional study
              of neural circuits. First, we developed gene trap and enhancer

              learning and spatial memory. Mice heterozygous for functional
              deletion of the NF1 gene (NF1(+/-) mice) also exhibit compromised
              spatial learning, and deficits in early-stage hippocampal
              long-term potentiation (LTP). Neurofibromin is a multifunctional
              protein which acts in part as an inhibitory constraint on Ras
              signalling, and the deficits in early-stage LTP and spatial
              learning have been linked to Ras hyperactivation. However, the
              downstream targets of Ras hyperactivation that lead to cognitive
              disruption are unknown. The levels of activity of signalling
              molecules potentially downstream of Ras were therefore studied in
              NF1(+/-) mice. Elevated phospho-ERK (pERK) levels were observed
              in the hippocampi from NF1(+/-) mice, while phospho-Akt/PKB
              (pAkt) and phospho-eIF4E (peIF4E) levels were unchanged relative
              to wild-type mice. Hippocampal levels of phospho-CREB (pCREB)
              were also increased, suggesting potential changes in late-phase
              LTP in NF1(+/-) mice. Indeed, LTP was found to be impaired for at
              least 4 h following induction in NF1(+/-) mice, linking
              neurofibromin function with the long-term maintenance of LTP.
              Remarkably, U0126, an inhibitor of ERK activation, at doses which
              reduced the hyperactive pERK levels in NF1(+/-) mice to the
              levels observed in control mice, caused a reduction in the
              deficits in early-phase LTP and completely rescued the long-term
              LTP deficits. In contrast to the abundant evidence that
              reductions in ERK activity lead to impaired plasticity, these
              data indicate that ERK hyperactivation in a partial model of type

              neurofibromas, hyperpigmentation of melanocytes and hamartomas of
              the iris. Some NF1 patients may also show neurologic lesions,
              such as optic pathway gliomas, dural ectasia and aqueduct
              stenosis. Importantly, learning disabilities occur in 30\% to
              45\% of patients with NF1, even in the absence of any apparent
              neural pathology. The learning disabilities may include a
              depression in mean IQ scores, visuoperceptual problems and
              impairments in spatial cognitive abilities. Spatial learning has
              been assessed with a variety of cognitive tasks and the most
              consistent spatial learning deficits have been observed with the

              some of these deficits could be secondary to developmental
              abnormalities and other neurological problems, such as poor motor
              coordination and attentional deficits. Previous studies have
              suggested a role for neurofibromin in brain function. First, the
              expression of the Nf1 gene is largely restricted to neuronal
              tissues in the adult. Second, this GTPase activating protein may
              act as a negative regulator of neurotrophin-mediated signalling.
              Third, immunohistochemical studies suggest that activation of
              astrocytes may be common in the brain of NF1 patients. Here, we
              show that the Nf1+/- mutation also affects learning and memory in
              mice. As in humans, the learning and memory deficits of the
              Nf1+/- mice are restricted to specific types of learning, they
              are not fully penetrant, they can be compensated for with

              Western blotting to assess four synaptic proteins: synaptophysin,
              growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), complexin I and complexin
              II, which inform about somewhat different aspects of the synaptic
              circuitry. Synaptophysin, complexin II and GAP-43 were reduced in
              bipolar disorder. The decreases correlated with the duration of

              the structural rearrangements leading to synaptic downscaling.

              delicate process, which in many cases can be influenced by
              environmental factors. The mechanisms controlling zebrafish sex
              determination and differentiation are not known. To date no sex
              linked genes have been identified in zebrafish and no sex
              chromosomes have been identified. However, a number of genes, as
              presented here, have been linked to the process of sex
              determination or differentiation in zebrafish. The zebrafish
              FTZ-F1 genes are of central interest as they are involved in
              regulating interrenal development and thereby steroid
              biosynthesis, as well as that they show expression patterns
              congruent with reproductive tissue differentiation and function.
              Zebrafish can be sex reversed by exposure to estrogens,
              suggesting that the estrogen levels are crucial during sex
              differentiation. The Cyp19 gene product aromatase converts
              testosterone into 17 beta-estradiol, and when inhibited leads to
              male to female sex reversal. FTZ-F1 genes are strongly linked to
              steroid biosynthesis and the regulatory region of Cyp19 contains
              binding sites for FTZ-F1 genes, further linking FTZ-F1 to this

              determination (PSD), where the decision is made by the allelic
              combinations of several loci. These loci are typically dispersed

              might be located on a preferential pair of (sex) chromosomes. The
              PSD system has a much higher level of variation of SD genotypes

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: The hypothalamus plays an important role in
              regulating sleep, but few hypothalamic sleep-promoting signaling
              pathways have been identified. Here we demonstrate a role for the
              neuropeptide QRFP (also known as P518 and 26RFa) and its
              receptors in regulating sleep in zebrafish, a diurnal vertebrate.
              We show that QRFP is expressed in ∼10 hypothalamic neurons in
              zebrafish larvae, which project to the hypothalamus, hindbrain,
              and spinal cord, including regions that express the two zebrafish
              QRFP receptor paralogs. We find that the overexpression of QRFP
              inhibits locomotor activity during the day, whereas mutation of
              qrfp or its receptors results in increased locomotor activity and
              decreased sleep during the day. Despite the restriction of these
              phenotypes to the day, the circadian clock does not regulate qrfp
              expression, and entrained circadian rhythms are not required for
              QRFP-induced rest. Instead, we find that QRFP overexpression
              decreases locomotor activity largely in a light-specific manner.
              Our results suggest that QRFP signaling plays an important role
              in promoting sleep and may underlie some aspects of hypothalamic
              sleep control. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The hypothalamus is
              thought to play a key role in regulating sleep in vertebrate
              animals, but few sleep-promoting signaling pathways that function
              in the hypothalamus have been identified. Here we use the
              zebrafish, a diurnal vertebrate, to functionally and anatomically
              characterize the neuropeptide QRFP. We show that QRFP is
              exclusively expressed in a small number of neurons in the larval
              zebrafish hypothalamus that project widely in the brain. We also
              show that QRFP overexpression reduces locomotor activity, whereas
              animals that lack QRFP signaling are more active and sleep less.
              These results suggest that QRFP signaling participates in the
              hypothalamic regulation of sleep.",

              rerio) could provide valuable insight into developmental factors

              predicated on the ability to accurately and reliably quantify
              subtle behavioral changes. Similarly, characterizing local
              molecular and morphological phenotypes requires knowledge of the
              neuroanatomical correlates of social behavior. We leveraged
              behavioral and genetic tools in zebrafish to both refine our
              understanding of social behavior and identify brain regions
              important for driving it. We characterized visual social
              interactions between pairs of adult zebrafish and discovered that
              they perform a stereotyped orienting behavior that reflects
              social attention [2]. Furthermore, in pairs of fish, the
              orienting behavior of one individual is the primary factor
              driving the same behavior in the other individual. We used manual
              and genetic lesions to investigate the forebrain contribution to
              this behavior and identified a population of neurons in the
              ventral telencephalon whose ablation suppresses social
              interactions, while sparing other locomotor and visual behaviors.
              These neurons are cholinergic and express the gene encoding the
              transcription factor Lhx8a, which is required for development of
              cholinergic neurons in the mouse forebrain [3]. The neuronal
              population identified in zebrafish lies in a region homologous to
              mammalian forebrain regions implicated in social behavior such as
              the lateral septum [4]. Our data suggest that an evolutionarily

              motoneurons are known to enlarge their presynaptic axon terminals

              preexisting vessels (angiogenesis). Endothelial-specific receptor
              tyrosine kinases and their ligands are known to be essential for
              these processes. Targeted disruption of vascular endothelial
              growth factor (VEGF) or its receptor kdr (flk1, VEGFR2) in mouse
              embryos results in a severe reduction of all blood vessels, while
              the complete loss of flt1 (VEGFR1) leads to an increased number
              of hemangioblasts and a disorganized vasculature. In a
              large-scale forward genetic screen, we identified two allelic
              zebrafish mutants in which the sprouting of blood vessels is
              specifically disrupted without affecting the assembly and
              differentiation of angioblasts. Molecular cloning revealed
              nonsense mutations in flk1. Analysis of mRNA expression in flk1
              mutant embryos showed that flk1 expression was severely
              downregulated, while the expression of other genes (scl, gata1,
              and fli1) involved in vasculogenesis or hematopoiesis was
              unchanged. Overexpression of vegf(121+165) led to the formation
              of additional vessels only in sibling larvae, not in flk1
              mutants. We demonstrate that flk1 is not required for proper
              vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos. However,
              the disruption of flk1 impairs the formation or function of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Zebrafish have been used as a model to study
              circadian rhythms (CRs) for over 20 years by analyzing various
              endpoints including locomotor activity. Such studies often
              utilize high-throughput analysis monitoring activity of larvae
              placed in well plates numbering >48 wells per plate. Although the
              CR can be influenced by numerous factors, it is not clear if such
              effects are permanent. Here, we investigated the variability of
              CRs of larvae analyzed in different types of well plates and
              determined the permanency of experimentally-induced aberrations
              in CRs. NEW METHOD: Utilized the tracking software Ethovision XT
              to investigate how different well plate sizes influence the CR.
              Re-tested subjects for recovery from long-term CR disruptions and
              evaluated CR patterns at the individual level. RESULTS: CR
              tracking using locomotion as a readout is best in 24 well plates.
              CR consistency is not maintained in larvae tracked in 48 or 96
              well plates. A perturbed CR due to constant light recovered after
              just 3 days of a normal light/dark cycle. COMPARISON WITH
              EXISTING METHODS: Unlike other CR locomotor-based assays, our
              approach allowed for a medium-throughput analysis of individual
              CRs, minimized variability and allowed for the re-evaluation of
              larval CRs 4-5 days later. CONCLUSIONS: This medium-throughput
              locomotor CR analysis allows for a standardized, less variable
              approach whereby larvae can be re-tested to identify potential
              long-term changes after experimental manipulations. Long-term
              behavioral experiments in 48 or 96 well plates may impart stress
              on the larvae due to space constraints which could impact nervous
              system function and/or behavior.",

              their high computational cost. Because of this, these methods
              have found limited application to clinical situations where fast
              execution is required, e.g., intraoperative imaging. This paper
              presents a parallel implementation of a nonrigid image
              registration algorithm. It takes advantage of shared-memory
              multiprocessor computer architectures using multithreaded
              programming by partitioning of data and partitioning of tasks,
              depending on the computational subproblem. For three different

              contrast-enhanced MR mammography, intersubject brain
              registration), the scaling behavior of the algorithm is
              quantitatively analyzed. The method is demonstrated to perform
              the computation of intra-operative brain deformation in less than
              a minute using 64 CPUs on a 128-CPU shared-memory supercomputer
              (SGI Origin 3800). It is shown that its serial component is no
              more than 2\% of the total computation time, allowing a speedup
              of at least a factor of 50. In most cases, the theoretical limit
              of the speedup is substantially higher (up to 132-fold in the

              Segmentation by intensity-based nonrigid registration to atlas
              images is applied to confocal microscopy images acquired from the
              brains of 20 bees. This paper evaluates and compares four
              different approaches for atlas image selection: registration to
              an individual atlas image (IND), registration to an average-shape
              atlas image (AVG), registration to the most similar image from a
              database of individual atlas images (SIM), and registration to
              all images from a database of individual atlas images with
              subsequent multi-classifier decision fusion (MUL). The MUL
              strategy is a novel application of multi-classifier techniques,
              which are common in pattern recognition, to atlas-based
              segmentation. For each atlas selection strategy, the segmentation
              performance of the algorithm was quantified by the similarity
              index (SI) between the automatic segmentation result and a
              manually generated gold standard. The best segmentation accuracy
              was achieved using the MUL paradigm, which resulted in a mean
              similarity index value between manual and automatic segmentation
              of 0.86 (AVG, 0.84; SIM, 0.82; IND, 0.81). The superiority of the
              MUL strategy over the other three methods is statistically
              significant (two-sided paired t test, P < 0.001). Both the MUL
              and AVG strategies performed better than the best possible SIM
              and IND strategies with optimal a posteriori atlas selection
              (mean similarity index for optimal SIM, 0.83; for optimal IND,
              0.81). Our findings show that atlas selection is an important
              issue in atlas-based segmentation and that, in particular,

              foundation is a connectome, a complete matrix of structural

              individual neurons, and nanoconnections at synapses. A long

              revolutionized at the meso- and microlevels by Cajal and others

              mid-twentieth century with the advent of electron microscopy. The

              prior odorant exposure results in a selective reduction of
              response to this odorant. Both short-term (STH) and long-term

              odorant-selective, glomerulus-specific projection neurons(PNs).
              The need for the vesicular glutamate transporter in LNs indicates
              that a subset of these GABAergic neurons also releases glutamate.
              LTH is associated with a reduction of odorant-evoked calcium
              fluxes in PNs as well as growth of the respective
              odorant-responsive glomeruli. These cellular changes use similar
              mechanisms to those required for behavioral habituation. Taken
              together with the observation that enhancement of GABAergic
              transmission is sufficient to attenuate olfactory behavior, these
              data indicate that habituation arises from glomerulus-selective
              potentiation of inhibitory synapses in the antennal lobe. We
              suggest that similar circuit mechanisms may operate in other
              species and sensory systems.",

               by a decremented response to repeated stimulation. It is
               typically framed as a process of selective attention, allowing
               animals to ignore irrelevant stimuli in order to free up limited
               cognitive resources. However, habituation can also occur to
               threatening and toxic stimuli, suggesting that habituation may
               serve other functions. Here we took advantage of a
               high-throughput Caenorhabditis elegans learning assay to
               investigate habituation to noxious stimuli. Using real-time
               computer vision software for automated behavioral tracking and
               optogenetics for controlled activation of a polymodal
               nociceptor, ASH, we found that neuropeptides mediated
               habituation and performed an RNAi screen to identify candidate
               receptors. Through subsequent mutant analysis and
               cell-type-specific gene expression, we found that
               pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptides function
               redundantly to promote habituation via PDFR-1-mediated cAMP
               signaling in both neurons and muscles. Behavioral analysis
               during learning acquisition suggests that response habituation
               and sensitization of locomotion are parts of a shifting
               behavioral strategy orchestrated by pigment dispersing factor
               signaling to promote dispersal away from repeated aversive
               stimuli. The long held notion that habituation is simply
               learning to ignore a repeated stimulus has been challenged by
               this work showing that habituation reflects a shift in response
               strategy to escape a repeated aversive stimulus. The laboratory
               of Dr. Catharine Rankin at the University of British Columbia
               used a microscopic roundworm (C. elegans) to investigate
               habituation to aversive stimuli in an attempt to understand why
               an animal would decrease responding to something potentially
               dangerous. Using computer vision software for detailed
               behavioral analyses, they found that for C. elegans, habituation
               is part of a behavioral strategy to disperse to safety away from
               the site of stimulation. Through a genetic analysis they
               identified a key signaling system underlying this process. This

              the deadbox helicase me31B, and argonaute1 (ago1) mutants, as
              well as coimmunoprecitation of dFMR1 with Atx2, indicate that

              neurogenesis. Pertinent to the general debate regarding the
              relative contribution of adult neurogenesis to memory, we found
              that memory gain by VEGF overexpression and memory impairment by
              VEGF blockade were already evident at early time points at which
              newly added neurons could not yet have become functional.
              Surprisingly, VEGF induction markedly increased in vivo long-term
              potentiation (LTP) responses in the dentate gyrus, and VEGF
              blockade completely abrogated LTP. Switching off ectopic VEGF
              production resulted in a return to a normal memory and LTP,
              indicating that ongoing VEGF is required to maintain increased
              plasticity. In summary, the study not only uncovered a surprising
              role for VEGF in neuronal plasticity, but also suggests that
              improved memory by VEGF is primarily a result of increasing
              plasticity of mature neurons rather than the contribution of
              newly added hippocampal neurons.",

              the GluN2B subunit (GluNR-2B). VEGF induces a rapid
              redistribution of GluNR-2B at synaptic sites by increasing the
              surface dynamics of these receptors within the membrane.

              the larval stage make it a vertebrate model of choice for
              brain-wide in-vivo functional imaging. However, current
              point-scanning imaging techniques, such as two-photon or confocal
              microscopy, impose a strong limit on acquisition speed which in
              turn sets the number of neurons that can be simultaneously
              recorded. At 5 Hz, this number is of the order of one thousand,
              i.e., approximately 1-2\% of the brain. Here we demonstrate that
              this limitation can be greatly overcome by using Selective-plane
              Illumination Microscopy (SPIM). Zebrafish larvae expressing the
              genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3 were illuminated
              with a scanned laser sheet and imaged with a camera whose optical
              axis was oriented orthogonally to the illumination plane. This
              optical sectioning approach was shown to permit functional
              imaging of a very large fraction of the brain volume of
              5-9-day-old larvae with single- or near single-cell resolution.
              The spontaneous activity of up to 5,000 neurons was recorded at
              20 Hz for 20-60 min. By rapidly scanning the specimen in the
              axial direction, the activity of 25,000 individual neurons from 5
              different z-planes (approximately 30\% of the entire brain) could
              be simultaneously monitored at 4 Hz. Compared to point-scanning
              techniques, this imaging strategy thus yields a ≃20-fold increase
              in data throughput (number of recorded neurons times acquisition
              rate) without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The
              extended field of view offered by the SPIM method allowed us to
              directly identify large scale ensembles of neurons, spanning
              several brain regions, that displayed correlated activity and
              were thus likely to participate in common neural processes. The

              antiangiogenesis agents, have been applied in the cancer
              treatment. However, currently most of these anticancer drugs
              suffer some adverse effects. Discovery of novel VEGFR2 inhibitors
              as anticancer drug candidates is still needed. EXPERIMENTAL
              DESIGN: In this investigation, we adopted a restricted de novo
              design method to design VEGFR2 inhibitors. We selected the most
              potent compound SKLB1002 and analyzed its inhibitory effects on
              human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Tumor
              xenografts in zebrafish and athymic mice were used to examine the
              in vivo activity of SKLB1002. RESULTS: The use of the restricted
              de novo design method indeed led to a new potent VEGFR2
              inhibitor, SKLB1002, which could significantly inhibit HUVEC
              proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation. Western
              blot analysis was conducted, which indicated that SKLB1002
              inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 kinase and the
              downstream protein kinases including extracellular
              signal-regulated kinase, focal adhesion kinase, and Src. In vivo
              zebrafish model experiments showed that SKLB1002 remarkably
              blocked the formation of intersegmental vessels in zebrafish
              embryos. It was further found to inhibit a new microvasculature
              in zebrafish embryos induced by inoculated tumor cells. Finally,
              compared with the solvent control, administration of 100 mg/kg/d
              SKLB1002 reached more than 60\% inhibition against human tumor
              xenografts in athymic mice. The antiangiogenic effect was
              indicated by CD31 immunohistochemical staining and
              alginate-encapsulated tumor cell assay. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
              suggest that SKLB1002 inhibits angiogenesis and may be a
              potential drug candidate in anticancer therapy.",

              reported. We address this issue using Tg[vsx1:GFP] zebrafish, a
              model system in which high GFP expression is initiated near the
              final stage of p2 progenitors. Cell fates were followed in
              progeny using time-lapse microscopy. Results indicate that the
              vast majority, if not all, of GFP-labeled p2 progenitors divide
              once to produce V2a/V2b neuron pairs, indicating that V2a and V2b
              neurons are generated by the asymmetric division of
              pair-producing progenitor cells. Together with evidence that
              Notch signaling is involved in the cell fate specification
              process, our results strongly suggest that Delta-Notch
              interactions between sister cells play a crucial role in the
              final outcome of these asymmetric divisions. This mechanism for
              determining cell fate is similar to asymmetric divisions that
              occur during Drosophila neurogenesis, where ganglion mother cells
              divide once to produce distinct neurons. However, unlike in
              Drosophila, the divisional axes of p2 progenitors in zebrafish
              were not fixed. We report that the terminal division of
              pair-producing progenitor cells in vertebrate neurogenesis can
              reproducibly produce two distinct neurons through a mechanism
              that may not depend on the orientation of the division axis.",

              advances in genetics, imaging, and computational methods now
              allow the collection of such information brain-wide. However, due
              to technical considerations, disparate datasets may use different
              references and may not be aligned to the same coordinate space.
              Two recent larval zebrafish atlases exemplify this problem:
              Z-Brain, containing gene expression, neural activity, and
              neuroanatomical segmentations, was acquired using
              immunohistochemical stains, while the Zebrafish Brain Browser
              (ZBB) was constructed from live scans of fluorescent reporters in
              transgenic larvae. Although different references were used, the
              atlases included several common transgenic patterns that provide
              potential ``bridges'' for transforming each into the other's
              coordinate space. We tested multiple bridging channels and
              registration algorithms and found that the symmetric
              diffeomorphic normalization algorithm improved live brain
              registration precision while better preserving cell morphology
              than B-spline-based registrations. Symmetric diffeomorphic
              normalization also corrected for tissue distortion introduced
              during fixation. Multi-reference channel optimization provided a
              transformation that enabled Z-Brain and ZBB to be co-aligned with
              precision of approximately a single cell diameter and minimal
              perturbation of cell and tissue morphology. Finally, we developed
              software to visualize brain regions in 3 dimensions, including a
              virtual reality neuroanatomy explorer. This study demonstrates
              the feasibility of integrating whole brain datasets, despite

              the field excitatory postsynaptic potential from the CA1
              dendritic layer in hippocampal brain slices from mice.
              Application of melatonin produced a concentration-dependent
              inhibition of the induction of long-term potentiation, with a
              concentration of 100 nm producing an approximately 50\%
              inhibition of long-term potentiation magnitude. Long-duration
              melatonin treatments of 6 h were also effective at reducing the
              magnitude of long-term potentiation. Melatonin (100 nm) did not
              alter baseline evoked responses or paired-pulse facilitation
              recorded at this synapse. The inhibitory actions of melatonin
              were prevented by application of the melatonin (MT) receptor
              antagonist luzindole as well as the MT2 receptor subtype
              antagonist 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetraline. These inhibitory
              actions of melatonin were lost in mice deficient in MT2 receptors

              application of the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 both mimicked
              the effects of melatonin and precluded further inhibition by
              melatonin. Finally, the application an activator of adenylyl
              cyclase, forskolin, overcame the inhibitory effects of melatonin
              on LTP without affecting the induction of long-term potentiation
              on its own. These results suggest that hippocampal synaptic

              of understanding factors that maintain synaptic strength and
              prevent unwanted synaptic changes. Here we present evidence that
              recurrent inhibitory connections in the CA1 region of hippocampus
              may contribute to this task by modulating the relative ability to
              induce long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD). Bath
              application of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A agonist
              muscimol to hippocampal slices increased the range of frequencies
              that produce LTD, whereas in the presence of the GABA type A
              antagonist picrotoxin LTD was induced only at very low
              stimulation frequencies (0.25-0.5 Hz). Because one source of
              GABAergic input to CA1 pyramidal cells is via recurrent
              inhibition, we tested the prediction that elevated postsynaptic
              spike activity would increase feedback GABA inhibition and favor
              the induction of LTD. By using an induction stimulation of 8 Hz,
              which alone produced no net change in synaptic strength, we found
              that stimulation presented during antidromic activation of
              pyramidal cell spikes induced LTD. This effect was blocked by

              self-reinforcing, runaway changes in synapse strength. A
              mechanism of this sort may help maintain patterns of synaptic

              synaptic transmission including its experimentally induced form,
              long-term potentiation (LTP), is affected by sensory deprivation
              in neocortex. This study is devoted to assess if dark rearing and
              a dark phase synthesized hormone melatonin influence LTP in the
              hippocampus, an area of brain involved in learning and memory. In
              vivo experiments were carried out on two groups of 45-days-old

              groups. Stimulating the Schaffer collaterals of CA3 area of
              hippocampus extracellular postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were
              recorded in the CA1 area. Having the stable baseline responses to
              the test pulses, the hippocampus was perfused by either vehicle
              or 2 microg melatonin and EPSPs were recorded for 30 min. Then,
              for induction of LTP, the tetanus was applied to the Schaffer
              collaterals and the field potentials were pooled for 120-min
              post-tetanus. The light deprivation resulted in a significant
              augmentation in the amplitude of baseline responses. Also, we
              observed a melatonin-induced increase in amplitude of the
              baseline recordings in either LR or DR animals. Tetanic
              stimulation elicited LTP of EPSPs in both LR and DR groups,
              robustly in the former where it lasted for about 90 min.
              Generally, melatonin inhibited the production of LTP in the two
              groups especially in the LR animals leading to a noticeable
              depression. We concluded that higher level of neuronal activity
              in the DR rats gives rise to a lower level of LTP. Weaker effect
              of melatonin on blocking the potentiation of post-tetanus EPSPs
              in the DR rats may be the result of a desensitization of

              of this diversity falls neatly into place along phylogenetic
              lines leading to firm generalizations: i) in all vertebrates

              pineal gland and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), ii) in many

              any mammals) there are extraretinal (and extrapineal) circadian

  abstract = "The optokinetic reflex (OKR) is a basic visual reflex exhibited
              by most vertebrates and plays an important role in stabilizing
              the eye relative to the visual scene. However, the OKR requires
              that an animal detect moving stripes and it is possible that fish
              that fail to exhibit an OKR may not be completely blind. One
              zebrafish mutant, the no optokinetic response c (nrc) has no OKR
              under any light conditions tested and was reported to be
              completely blind. Previously, we have shown that OFF-ganglion
              cell activity can be recorded in these mutants. To determine
              whether mutant fish with no OKR such as the nrc mutant can detect
              simple light increments and decrements we developed the visual
              motor behavioral assay (VMR). In this assay, single zebrafish
              larvae are placed in each well of a 96-well plate allowing the
              simultaneous monitoring of larvae using an automated
              video-tracking system. The locomotor responses of each larva to
              30 minutes light ON and 30 minutes light OFF were recorded and
              quantified. WT fish have a brief spike of motor activity upon
              lights ON, known as the startle response, followed by return to
              lower-than baseline activity, called a freeze. WT fish also
              sharply increase their locomotor activity immediately following
              lights OFF and only gradually (over several minutes) return to
              baseline locomotor activity. The nrc mutants respond similarly to
              light OFF as WT fish, but exhibit a slight reduction in their
              average activity as compared to WT fish. Motor activity in
              response to light ON in nrc mutants is delayed and sluggish.
              There is a slow rise time of the nrc mutant response to light ON
              as compared to WT light ON response. The results indicate that
              nrc fish are not completely blind. Because teleosts can detect
              light through non-retinal tissues, we confirmed that the
              immediate behavioral responses to light-intensity changes require
              intact eyes by using the chokh (chk) mutants, which completely
              lack eyes from the earliest stages of development. In our VMR
              assay, the chk mutants exhibit no startle response to either
              light ON or OFF, showing that the lateral eyes mediate this
              behavior. The VMR assay described here complements the
              well-established OKR assay, which does not test the ability of
              zebrafish larvae to respond to changes in light intensities.
              Additionally, the automation of the VMR assay lends itself to
              high-throughput screening for defects in light-intensity driven
              visual responses.",

              self-generated motor and sensory signals in order to guide motor
              behavior and adaptation. The cerebellum is a vertebrate hindbrain
              region where all of these signals converge and that has been
              implicated in the acquisition, coordination, and calibration of
              motor activity. Theories of cerebellar function postulate that
              granule cells encode a variety of sensorimotor signals in the
              cerebellar input layer. These models suggest that representations
              should be high-dimensional, sparse, and temporally patterned.
              However, in vivo physiological recordings addressing these points
              have been limited and in particular have been unable to measure
              the spatiotemporal dynamics of population-wide activity. In this
              study, we use both calcium imaging and electrophysiology in the
              awake larval zebrafish to investigate how cerebellar granule
              cells encode three types of sensory stimuli as well as

              all granule cells are active in response to these stimuli, such

              find instead that most responses belong to only one of a small
              number of distinct activity profiles, which are temporally
              homogeneous and anatomically clustered. We furthermore identify
              granule cells that are active during swimming behaviors and

              activation of non-selective neurons decreased performance,

  abstract = "For a long time, alcohol was thought to exert a general
              depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS). However,
              currently the consensus is that specific regions of the brain are
              selectively vulnerable to the acute effects of alcohol. An
              alcohol-induced blackout is the classic example; the subject is
              temporarily unable to form new long-term memories while
              relatively maintaining other skills such as talking or even
              driving. A recent study showed that alcohol can cause retrograde
              memory impairment, that is, blackouts due to retrieval
              impairments as well as those due to deficits in encoding.
              Alcoholic blackouts may be complete (en bloc) or partial
              (fragmentary) depending on severity of memory impairment. In
              fragmentary blackouts, cueing often aids recall. Memory
              impairment during acute intoxication involves dysfunction of
              episodic memory, a type of memory encoded with spatial and social
              context. Recent studies have shown that there are multiple memory
              systems supported by discrete brain regions, and the acute
              effects of alcohol on learning and memory may result from
              alteration of the hippocampus and related structures on a
              cellular level. A rapid increase in blood alcohol concentration
              (BAC) is most consistently associated with the likelihood of a
              blackout. However, not all subjects experience blackouts,
              implying that genetic factors play a role in determining CNS
              vulnerability to the effects of alcohol. This factor may
              predispose an individual to alcoholism, as altered memory
              function during intoxication may affect an individual's alcohol
              expectancy; one may perceive positive aspects of intoxication
              while unintentionally ignoring the negative aspects. Extensive
              research on memory and learning as well as findings related to
              the acute effects of alcohol on the brain may elucidate the
              mechanisms and impact associated with the alcohol-induced

              and made available to premotor neurons that convey the
              information to spinal motor circuits. We studied the neural
              substrate of this specialized visuomotor system using high-speed
              video recordings of larval zebrafish and laser ablations of
              candidate brain structures. Seven-day-old zebrafish oriented
              toward, chased, and consumed paramecia with high accuracy.
              Lesions of the retinotectal neuropil primarily abolished
              orienting movements toward the prey. Wild-type fish tested in
              darkness, as well as blind mutants, were impaired similarly to
              tectum-ablated animals, suggesting that prey capture is mainly
              visually mediated. To trace the pathway further, we examined the
              role of two pairs of identified reticulospinal neurons, MeLc and
              MeLr, located in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal
              fasciculus of the tegmentum. These two neurons extend dendrites
              into the ipsilateral tectum and project axons into the spinal

              reticulospinal neurons did not impair prey capture, suggesting a
              selective function of MeLr and MeLc in this behavior. Ablating
              MeLc and MeLr neurons unilaterally in conjunction with the
              contralateral tectum also mostly abolished prey capture, but
              ablating them together with the ipsilateral tectum had a much
              smaller effect. These results suggest that MeLc and MeLr function

              stimulus features that are extracted by the visual system is
              still unclear. Furthermore, the neural mechanisms that compute
              object approach are largely unknown. We found that a virtual
              looming stimulus, i.e., a dark expanding disk on a bright
              background, reliably evoked rapid escape movements. Related
              stimuli, such as dimming, receding, or bright looming objects,
              were substantially less effective, and angular size was a
              critical determinant of escape initiation. Two-photon calcium
              imaging in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons revealed three
              retinorecipient areas that responded robustly to looming stimuli.
              One of these areas, the optic tectum, is innervated by a subset

              Laser-induced lesions of the tectal neuropil impaired the

              chick pineal cells in static culture, which displays a rhythm of
              melatonin release for at least two weeks under cyclic lighting
              conditions, and for at least 4 cycles under constant red light.
              Using a rapid and specific extraction assay for the
              [14C]melatonin formed (from [14C]trytoophan) and secreted by
              these cells, we have examined the effects of perturbations
              (light, dark, and potassium) on the amplitude, period, and phase
              of the melatonin rhythm. The period in constant red light was
              close to 20 h, but in constant white light (or 12:12 cycles) it
              was closer to 24 h. Four-hour pulses of white light (in otherwise
              constant red light) caused an acute fall in melatonin output, and
              phase-dependent phase shifts of the rhythm relative to controls.
              Pulses of darkness (in otherwise constant red light) tended to
              increase melatonin output, and caused phase-dependent phase
              shifts. Elevated potassium concentrations increased melatonin
              output and the amplitude of the rhythm, but did not change the
              period. Four-hour pulses of low (5.4 mM) potassium (in otherwise
              constant high potassium) mimicked the acute effect of light,
              reducing melatonin output, but did not induce appreciable phase
              shifts. Changes in membrane potential appear more likely to be
              involved in the regulation of melatonin output (and thus be

              antagonism in the orientation domain. Individual ganglion cells
              receive excitatory synapses tuned to different orientations, but
              feedforward inhibition generates a high-pass filter that only
              transmits the initial activation of these inputs, removing
              redundancy. These results demonstrate how a dynamic predictive

              understanding visual processing in vertebrates. The tectum has

              of studies focusing on the processes by which tectal circuits
              receive and process retinally-derived visual information.
              Recently, a handful of studies have shown a much more complex
              role for the optic tectum in larval zebrafish, and anatomical and
              functional data from these studies suggest that this role extends
              beyond the visual system, and beyond the processing of
              exclusively retinal inputs. Consistent with this evolving view of
              the tectum, we have used a Gal4 enhancer trap line to identify
              direct projections from rostral hypothalamus (RH) to the tectal

              Stress and sex hormones exert their effects on brain structural
              remodeling through both classical genomic as well as non-genomic
              mechanisms, and they do so in collaboration with
              neurotransmitters and other intra- and extracellular mediators.
              This review will illustrate the actions of estrogen on synapse

              these? We developed a simple assay to measure the acute effects
              of drugs on C.elegans movement and examined the effects of a
              range of compounds including neuroactive drugs, toxins,
              environmental stresses and novel compounds on worm movement over
              a time period of 3 hours. We find that many treatments show
              complex acute responses, where a phase of rapid paralysis is
              followed by one or more recovery phases. The recoveries are not
              the result of some generic stress response but are specific to
              the drug e.g. recovery from paralysis due to a neuroactive drug
              requires neurotransmitter pathways whereas recovery from a
              metabolic inhibitor requires metabolic changes. Finally, we also
              find that acute responses can vary greatly across development and
              that there is extensive and complex natural variation in acute
              responses. In summary, acute responses are sensitive probes of

              process in cortical synaptic network plasticity and memory
              formation. Hebbian forms of LTP depend on strong postsynaptic
              depolarization, which in many models is generated by action
              potentials that propagate back from the soma into dendrites.
              However, local dendritic depolarization has been shown to mediate
              these forms of LTP as well. As pyramidal cells in supragranular
              layers of the somatosensory cortex spike infrequently, it is
              unclear which of the two mechanisms prevails for those cells in
              vivo. Using whole-cell recordings in the mouse somatosensory
              cortex in vivo, we demonstrate that rhythmic sensory whisker
              stimulation efficiently induces synaptic LTP in layer 2/3 (L2/3)
              pyramidal cells in the absence of somatic spikes. The induction
              of LTP depended on the occurrence of NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate
              receptor)-mediated long-lasting depolarizations, which bear
              similarities to dendritic plateau potentials. In addition, we
              show that whisker stimuli recruit synaptic networks that
              originate from the posteromedial complex of the thalamus (POm).
              Photostimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 expressing POm neurons
              generated NMDAR-mediated plateau potentials, whereas the
              inhibition of POm activity during rhythmic whisker stimulation
              suppressed the generation of those potentials and prevented
              whisker-evoked LTP. Taken together, our data provide evidence for
              sensory-driven synaptic LTP in vivo, in the absence of somatic
              spiking. Instead, LTP is mediated by plateau potentials that are
              generated through the cooperative activity of lemniscal and

              two thalamic nuclei: the ventrobasalis (VB), which conveys

              modulatory and nociceptive input. Recently, we have shown that L4

              capacity for TC input to influence differentiation during

              Respecified L4 neurons were able to respond both to touch and to

              these sensory modalities in distinct cortical circuits. These

              important role in shaping an organism's daily pattern of
              activity. Nocturnal animals generally become more active in
              response to darkness (positive masking) and less active in
              response to light (negative masking), and diurnal animals
              generally have opposite patterns of response. These responses can

              studies have directly compared masking in diurnal and nocturnal
              species, and none have compared rhythms in masking behavior of
              diurnal and nocturnal species. Here, we assessed masking in

              at 6 Zeitgeber times (ZTs; with ZT0 = lights on). Light pulses
              during the dark phase produced negative masking in nocturnal mice
              but only at ZT14, whereas light pulses resulted in positive
              masking in diurnal grass rats across the dark phase. In both
              species, dark pulses had no effect on behavior. In the 2nd
              experiment, animals were kept in constant darkness or constant
              light and were presented with light or dark pulses, respectively,
              at 6 circadian times (CTs). CT0 corresponded to ZT0 of the

              either by presynaptic increases in glutamate release or by direct

              ($\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid)
              receptor function. Compelling models have more recently proposed
              that synaptic potentiation can occur by the recruitment of
              additional postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), sourced either
              from an intracellular reserve pool by exocytosis or from nearby
              extra-synaptic receptors pre-existing on the neuronal surface.
              However, the exact mechanism through which synapses can rapidly
              recruit new AMPARs during early LTP remains unknown. In
              particular, direct evidence for a pivotal role of AMPAR surface
              diffusion as a trafficking mechanism in synaptic plasticity is
              still lacking. Here, using AMPAR immobilization approaches, we

              immobilization in vivo in the dorsal hippocampus inhibited fear

              the early phase of contextual learning. Therefore, our results
              provide a direct demonstration that the recruitment of new
              receptors to synapses by surface diffusion is a critical
              mechanism for the expression of LTP and hippocampal learning.
              Since AMPAR surface diffusion is dictated by weak Brownian forces
              that are readily perturbed by protein-protein interactions, we
              anticipate that this fundamental trafficking mechanism will be a
              key target for modulating synaptic potentiation and learning.",

              undergoes preferential degradation in aging and various
              neuropsychiatric disorders. Memory storage of temporal and
              contextual associations is known to rely on hippocampal
              N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic
              plasticity, which depends ex vivo on dynamic organization of
              surface NMDARs. Whether NMDAR surface trafficking sustains the
              formation of associative memory, however, remains unknown.
              METHODS: We tested this hypothesis, using single nanoparticle
              imaging, electrophysiology, and behavioral approaches, in
              hippocampal networks challenged with a potent modulator of
              NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Fear conditioning is a form of learning essential for
              animal survival and used as a behavioral paradigm to study the
              mechanisms of learning and memory. In mammals, the amygdala plays
              a crucial role in fear conditioning. In teleost, the medial zone
              of the dorsal telencephalon (Dm) has been postulated to be a
              homolog of the mammalian amygdala by anatomical and ablation
              studies, showing a role in conditioned avoidance response.
              However, the neuronal populations required for a conditioned
              avoidance response via the Dm have not been functionally or
              genetically defined. RESULTS: We aimed to identify the neuronal
              population essential for fear conditioning through a genetic
              approach in zebrafish. First, we performed large-scale gene trap
              and enhancer trap screens, and created transgenic fish lines that
              expressed Gal4FF, an engineered version of the Gal4 transcription
              activator, in specific regions in the brain. We then crossed
              these Gal4FF-expressing fish with the effector line carrying the
              botulinum neurotoxin gene downstream of the Gal4 binding sequence
              UAS, and analyzed the double transgenic fish for active avoidance
              fear conditioning. We identified 16 transgenic lines with Gal4FF
              expression in various brain areas showing reduced performance in
              avoidance responses. Two of them had Gal4 expression in
              populations of neurons located in subregions of the Dm, which we
              named 120A-Dm neurons. Inhibition of the 120A-Dm neurons also
              caused reduced performance in Pavlovian fear conditioning. The
              120A-Dm neurons were mostly glutamatergic and had projections to
              other brain regions, including the hypothalamus and ventral
              telencephalon. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we identified a subpopulation
              of neurons in the zebrafish Dm essential for fear conditioning.
              We propose that these are functional equivalents of neurons in
              the mammalian pallial amygdala, mediating the conditioned
              stimulus-unconditioned stimulus association. Thus, the study
              establishes a basis for understanding the evolutionary
              conservation and diversification of functional neural circuits
              mediating fear conditioning in vertebrates.",

               rare, autosomal dominant disorders associated with PTEN germline
               mutations. PHTS patients routinely develop hamartomas, which are
               benign tissue overgrowths comprised of disorganized `normal'
               cells. Efforts to generate PHTS animal models have been largely
               unsuccessful due to the early lethality of homozygous germline
               mutations in Pten, together with the lack of hamartoma formation
               in most conditional mutants generated to date. We report herein
               a novel PHTS mouse model that reproducibly forms hamartoma-like
               lesions in the central retina by postnatal day 21. Specifically,
               we generated a Pten conditional knock-out (cKO) using a
               retinal-specific Pax6-Cre-driver that leads to a nearly complete
               deletion of Pten in the peripheral retina but produces a mosaic
               of `wild-type' and Pten cKO cells centrally. Structural defects
               were only observed in the mosaic central retina, including in
               M{\"u}ller glia and in the outer and inner limiting membranes,
               suggesting that defective mechanical integrity partly underlies
               the hamartoma-like pathology. Finally, we used this
               newly-developed model to test whether rapamycin, an mTOR
               inhibitor that is currently the only PHTS therapy, can block
               hamartoma growth. When administered in the early postnatal
               period, prior to hamartoma formation, rapamycin reduces
               hamartoma size, but also induces new morphological abnormalities
               in the Pten cKO retinal periphery. In contrast, administration
               of rapamycin after hamartoma initiation fails to reduce lesion
               size. We have thus generated and used an animal model of retinal
               PHTS to show that while current therapies reduce hamartoma
               formation, they also induce new retinal dysmorphologies.",

              including regulating circadian rhythms, sleep, pupil
              constriction, heart rate, hormone release and learning and

              in primary sensory neurons to regulate responses to mechanical
              stimuli and behavioral plasticity,specifically habituation, a
              conserved form of non-associative learning. The habituation
              phenotypes of cmk-1 mutants were dependent on interstimulus
              interval (ISI), such that CMK-1 slows habituation at short ISIs,
              but promotes it at long ISIs.We predicted potential CaMK
              phosphorylation targets from catalytic site analysis ofthe human
              and C. elegans CaMKs and mutant analysis of these candidates
              implicated O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase,
              OGT-1, in mechanosensitivity and learning. Cell specific rescue
              and knockdown experiments showed that bothCMK-1 and OGT-1
              function cell autonomously in mechanosensory neurons to modulate
              learning. Interestingly, despite their similar mutant phenotypes,
              detailed behavioral analysis of double mutants demonstrated that
              CMK-1 and OGT-1 act in parallel genetic pathways. Our research
              identifies CMK-1 and OGT-1 as co-expressed yet independent
              regulators of mechanosensitivity and learning.",

              exhibits a reflexive withdrawal of its gill and siphon in
              response to weak or moderate tactile stimulation of its skin.
              Repeated tactile stimulation causes this defensive withdrawal
              reflex to habituate. Both short-term habituation, lasting 24h,
              have been reported in Aplysia. Habituation of the withdrawal
              reflex correlates with, and is in part due to, depression of
              transmission at the monosynaptic connection between
              mechanoreceptive sensory neurons and motor neurons within the
              abdominal ganglion. Habituation-related short-term depression of
              the sensorimotor synapse appears to be due exclusively to
              presynaptic changes. However, changes within the sensory neuron,
              by themselves, do not account for more persistent depression of
              the sensorimotor synapse. Recent behavioral work suggests that
              long-term habituation in Aplysia critically involves postsynaptic
              processes, specifically, activation of AMPA- and NMDA-type
              receptors. In addition, long-term habituation requires activity
              of protein phosphatases, including protein phosphatases 1, 2A,
              and 2B, as well as activity of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.
              Cellular work has succeeded in demonstrating long-term,
              homosynaptic depression (LTD) of the sensorimotor synapse in
              dissociated cell culture and, more recently, LTD of the glutamate
              response of isolated motor neurons in culture (``hemisynaptic''
              LTD). These in vitro forms of LTD have mechanistic parallels to
              long-term habituation. In particular, homosynaptic LTD of the
              sensorimotor synapse requires elevated intracellular Ca2+ within
              the motor neuron, and hemisynaptic LTD requires activity of AMPA-
              and NMDA-type receptors. In addition, activation of group I and
              II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can induce
              hemisynaptic LTD. The demonstration of LTD in vitro opens up a
              promising new avenue for attempts to relate long-term habituation

              experiment, 9 days of acoustic or tactile stimulation were given
              to C57B/6 mice. Both stimulus modalities produced LTH. When on
              the 10th day stimuli of the other modality were given, in both
              cases the long term habituated group showed no lower startle
              amplitude than a non-stimulated control group. This indicates LTH

  abstract = "The early stages of the auditory system need to preserve the
              timing information of sounds in order to extract the basic
              features of acoustic stimuli. At the same time, different
              processes of neuronal adaptation occur at several levels to
              further process the auditory information. For instance, auditory
              nerve fiber responses already experience adaptation of their
              firing rates, a type of response that can be found in many other
              auditory nuclei and may be useful for emphasizing the onset of
              the stimuli. However, it is at higher levels in the auditory
              hierarchy where more sophisticated types of neuronal processing
              take place. For example, stimulus-specific adaptation, where
              neurons show adaptation to frequent, repetitive stimuli, but
              maintain their responsiveness to stimuli with different physical
              characteristics, thus representing a distinct kind of processing
              that may play a role in change and deviance detection. In the
              auditory cortex, adaptation takes more elaborate forms, and
              contributes to the processing of complex sequences, auditory
              scene analysis and attention. Here we review the multiple types
              of adaptation that occur in the auditory system, which are part
              of the pool of resources that the neurons employ to process the

              general, there is an agreement that short-term and long-term

              large conductance voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (BK)

              regulating synaptic transmission. Here, we tested mice deficient

              paradigms have provided valuable insight into how
              neuromodulation, and specifically norepinephrine/noradrenaline
              (NE) influences odor memory. In general, NE levels are modulated
              by arousal, stress, and behavioral state, but there is sparse
              evidence of a direct relationship between NE and odor memory in
              adult rodents. The present study uses simple mild psychological
              stressors (bright light and sound) to modulate NE levels
              physiologically in order to probe stressors NE-dependent effect
              on odor recognition memory. In rats with bilateral bulbar
              cannulations, we show that these stressors modulate olfactory
              memory and that this effect is at least partially mediated by the
              olfactory bulb. Specifically, we show that the presence of
              stressors during the acquisition of odor memory suppresses memory
              for an odor when tested 30 min after familiarization to that
              odor. This suppression is blocked by infusing NE antagonists into
              the olfactory bulb prior to odor acquisition. Additionally, we

              several other mental disorders. Despite extensive research in the
              past decades on habituation of startle and other escape
              responses, the underlying neural mechanisms are still not fully
              understood. There is evidence from previous studies indicating
              that BK channels might play a critical role in habituation. We
              here used a wide array of approaches to test this hypothesis. We
              show that BK channel activation and subsequent phosphorylation of

              underlying startle habituation in rats, using patch-clamp

              habituation is the most fundamental form of implicit learning.
              Habituation also represents a filter for inundating sensory
              information, which is disrupted in autism, schizophrenia, and
              other psychiatric disorders. Habituation has been studied in
              different organisms and behavioral models and is thought to be
              caused by synaptic depression in respective pathways. The
              underlying molecular mechanisms, however, are poorly understood.
              We here identify, for the first time, a BK channel-dependent
              molecular synaptic mechanism leading to synaptic depression that
              is crucial for habituation, and we discuss the significance of

              LY341495, a class II/III metabotropic glutamate receptor

               coordinated long-range communication between cells. The
               cerebrospinal fluid composition and flow properties regulate
               several aspects of central nervous system development, including
               progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, and migration [1--3].
               One understudied component of the cerebrospinal fluid, described
               over a century ago in vertebrates, is the Reissner fiber. This
               extracellular thread forming early in development results from
               the assembly of the SCO-spondin protein in the third and fourth
               brain ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord [4]. Up to
               now, the function of the Reissner fiber has remained elusive,
               partly due to the lack of genetic invalidation models [4]. Here,
               by mutating the scospondin gene, we demonstrate that the
               Reissner fiber is critical for the morphogenesis of a straight
               posterior body axis. In zebrafish mutants where the Reissner
               fiber is lost, ciliogenesis and cerebrospinal fluid flow are
               intact but body axis morphogenesis is impaired. Our results also
               explain the frequently observed phenotype that mutant embryos
               with defective cilia exhibit defects in body axis curvature.
               Here, we reveal that these mutants systematically fail to
               assemble the Reissner fiber. We show that cilia promote the
               formation of the Reissner fiber and that the fiber is necessary
               for proper body axis morphogenesis. Our study sets the stage for

              space, their behavior in the lab is almost exclusively scored in
              two dimensions, whereby zebrafish are recorded using a single
              camera providing 2D videos. Whether this dimensional reduction
              preserves the reliability of data has not been addressed. Here we
              show that, compared to a 3D observation, 2D data are flawed by
              over-reporting and under-reporting of locomotory differences.
              Specifically, we first reconstructed 3D trajectories through the
              integration of synchronous information derived from two cameras,

              the body and internally generated movements. Many animal bodies
              are inherently unstable, necessitating corrective locomotion to
              maintain stability. Understanding how developing animals come to
              balance remains a challenge. Here we study the interplay among
              environment, sensation, and action as balance develops in larval
              zebrafish. We first model the physical forces that challenge
              underwater balance and experimentally confirm that larvae are
              subject to constant destabilization. Larvae propel in swim bouts
              that, we find, tend to stabilize the body. We confirm the
              relationship between locomotion and balance by changing larval
              body composition, exacerbating instability and eliciting more
              frequent swimming. Intriguingly, developing zebrafish come to
              control the initiation of locomotion, swimming preferentially
              when unstable, thus restoring preferred postures. To test the
              sufficiency of locomotor-driven stabilization and the developing
              control of movement timing, we incorporate both into a generative
              model of swimming. Simulated larvae recapitulate observed
              postures and movement timing across early development, but only
              when locomotor-driven stabilization and control of movement
              initiation are both utilized. We conclude the ability to move

              processed in distinct channels, and then selectively recombine
              those features according to the demands of particular behavioral
              tasks. In primates, for example, there are distinct pathways for
              motion and form processing. While form vision utilizes color
              information, motion pathways receive input from only a subset of
              cone photoreceptors and are generally colorblind. To explore the
              link between early channeling of visual information and
              behavioral output across vertebrate species, we measured the
              chromatic inputs to the optomotor response of larval zebrafish.
              Using cone-isolating gratings, we found that there is a strong
              input from both red and green cones but not short-wavelength
              cones, which nevertheless do contribute to another behavior,
              phototaxis. Using a motion-nulling method, we measured precisely
              the input strength of gratings that stimulated cones in
              combination. The fish do not respond to gratings that stimulate
              different cone types out of phase, but have an enhanced response
              when the cones are stimulated together. This shows that red and
              green cone signals are pooled at a stage before motion detection.
              Since the two cone inputs are combined into a single 'luminance'
              channel, the response to sinusoidal gratings is colorblind.
              However, we also find that the relative contributions of the two
              cones at isoluminance varies with spatial frequency. Therefore,

              correlate with behavioural changes. However, modifiable synapses
              are generally embedded deep in complex circuits. In contrast, the

              The two C-starts are kinematically equivalent and variable in
              both phases, and the predictive C-starts - used in hunting - are
              adjusted in terms of the angle of turning and the final linear
              speed to where and when their prey will hit the water surface.
              Presently, nothing is known about the neural circuits that drive
              the archerfish C-starts. As the starting point for a
              neuroethological analysis, we first explored the presence and
              morphology of a pair of Mauthner cells, which are key cells in
              the teleost fast-start system. We show that archerfish have a
              typical Mauthner cell in each medullary hemisphere and that these

              a proximity-based mechanism where an evasive maneuver is
              triggered when a looming stimulus passes a subtended visual angle
              threshold. However, some escape strategies are more costly than
              others, and so it would be beneficial to additionally encode the
              level of threat conveyed by the predator's approach rate to
              select the most appropriate response. Here, using naturalistic
              rates of looming visual stimuli while simultaneously monitoring
              escape behavior and the recruitment of multiple reticulospinal
              neurons, we find that larval zebrafish do indeed perform a
              calibrated assessment of threat. While all fish generate evasive
              maneuvers at the same subtended visual angle, lower approach
              rates evoke slower, more kinematically variable escape responses

              344 schizophrenia risk genes (from the Psychiatric Genomics
              Consortium dataset) in lower organisms, including C. elegans,
              Drosophila and zebrafish, along with phenotypes produced by
              genetic disruption in C. elegans. Schizophrenia risk genes were
              evolutionarily conserved at significantly higher rates in C.
              elegans (81\%) and zebrafish (88\%) than genes in general for
              these two species (40-70\%). The risk-gene equivalents were
              highly (~3-fold) enriched for essential genes consistent with
              polygenic mutation threshold models, which propose that genetic
              susceptibility results from the inevitable expression of harmful
              combinations of risk variants in the population. Most notably,
              numerous examples of cross-species synteny revealed how blocks of
              risk genes geared toward a shared biological purpose coalesced
              into proximity during evolution. We obtained initial evidence

              development, potentially allowing differential modulation by the
              environment. Taken together, studies of the conservation of
              schizophrenia risk genes in simple model organisms provided novel

              approximately 10,000 tightly interconnected neurons, and the pair
              sit astride the mid-line third ventricle of the hypothalamus,
              immediately dorsal to the optic chiasm (Figure 1A). Together,
              they constitute the master circadian clock of the mammalian
              brain. They generate an internal representation of solar time
              that is conveyed to every cell in our body and in this way they
              co-ordinate the daily cycles of physiology and behaviour that
              adapt us to the twenty-four hour world. The temporary discomfort
              associated with jetlag is a reminder of the importance of this

               evolution of dormant stages able to tolerate a harsh environment
               outside the temporal window of favourable conditions [1]. Annual
               killifish have evolved to live in seasonal pools on the African
               savannah and display a range of adaptations to cope with an
               unpredictable environment [2,3]. For most of the year, killifish
               populations survive as diapausing embryos buried in dry
               sediment. When savannah depressions fill with rainwater, the
               fish hatch, grow rapidly and, after attaining sexual maturity,
               reproduce daily [2,4]. Nothobranchius furzeri, a model species
               in ageing research [2,3], is distributed in a region where the
               climate is particularly dry and rains are unpredictable [5].
               Here, we demonstrate that the fast juvenile growth and rapid
               sexual maturation shown by N. furzeri in captivity is actually
               an underestimate of their natural developmental rate. We
               estimated the age of N. furzeri in natural populations by
               counting daily-deposited increments in the otoliths and
               performing histological analysis of gonads. We found that N.
               furzeri are capable of reaching sexual maturity within 14 days
               after hatching, which to our knowledge is the fastest rate of
               sexual maturation recorded for a vertebrate. We also demonstrate
               that N. furzeri can grow from an initial length of 5 mm up to 54
               mm over the course of a two-week period. Such rapid juvenile
               development is likely to be adaptive since some pools were
               entirely desiccated 3--5 weeks after filling, but retained a
               viable killifish population that reproduced before the adults
               succumbed to the disappearance of their pool.",

              explicit memory in the mammalian hippocampus are associated with
              remodeling and growth of preexisting synapses and the formation
              of new synapses. Here, we compare and contrast structural
              components of the synaptic plasticity that underlies these two
              distinct forms of memory. In both cases, the structural changes
              involve time-dependent processes. Thus, some modifications are
              transient and may contribute to early formative stages of
              long-term memory, whereas others are more stable, longer lasting,
              and likely to confer persistence to memory storage. In addition,
              we explore the possibility that trans-synaptic signaling
              mechanisms governing de novo synapse formation during development
              can be reused in the adult for the purposes of structural
              synaptic plasticity and memory storage. Finally, we discuss how
              these mechanisms set in motion structural rearrangements that
              prepare a synapse to strengthen the same memory and, perhaps, to
              allow it to take part in other memories as a basis for
              understanding how their anatomical representation results in the

              layers. Little, however, is known about the emergence of this
              spatial arrangement. Here, we investigate how the three main
              types of retinal inhibitory neuron (RIN)--horizontal cells (HCs),
              inner nuclear layer amacrine cells (iACs) and displaced amacrine

              retinas, we show that RINs undergo distinct phases of migration.
              The first phase, common to all RINs, is bipolar migration
              directed towards the apicobasal centre of the retina. All RINs
              then transition to a less directionally persistent multipolar
              phase of migration. Finally, HCs, iACs and dACs each undergo cell

  abstract = "Despite their small brains, insects can navigate over long
              distances by orienting using visual landmarks [1], skylight
              polarization [2-9], and sun position [3, 4, 6, 10]. Although
              Drosophila are not generally renowned for their navigational
              abilities, mark-and-recapture experiments in Death Valley
              revealed that they can fly nearly 15 km in a single evening [11].
              To accomplish such feats on available energy reserves [12], flies
              would have to maintain relatively straight headings, relying on
              celestial cues [13]. Cues such as sun position and polarized
              light are likely integrated throughout the sensory-motor pathway
              [14], including the highly conserved central complex [4, 15, 16].
              Recently, a group of Drosophila central complex cells (E-PG
              neurons) have been shown to function as an internal compass
              [17-19], similar to mammalian head-direction cells [20]. Using an
              array of genetic tools, we set out to test whether flies can
              navigate using the sun and to identify the role of E-PG cells in
              this behavior. Using a flight simulator, we found that Drosophila
              adopt arbitrary headings with respect to a simulated sun, thus
              performing menotaxis, and individuals remember their heading
              preference between successive flights-even over several hours.
              Imaging experiments performed on flying animals revealed that the
              E-PG cells track sun stimulus motion. When these neurons are
              silenced, flies no longer adopt and maintain arbitrary headings
              relative to the sun stimulus but instead exhibit frontal
              phototaxis. Thus, without the compass system, flies lose the
              ability to execute menotaxis and revert to a simpler, reflexive
              behavior.",

              neural populations in many species, but inferring spike times
              from calcium signals is a challenging problem. We compared
              multiple approaches using multiple datasets with ground truth
              electrophysiology, and found that simple non-negative
              deconvolution (NND) outperformed all other algorithms on
              out-of-sample test data. We introduce a novel benchmark
              applicable to recordings without electrophysiological ground
              truth, based on the correlation of responses to two stimulus
              repeats, and used this to show that unconstrained NND also
              outperformed the other algorithms when run on ``zoomed out''
              datasets of ∼10,000 cell recordings from the visual cortex of
              mice of either sex. Finally, we show that NND-based methods match
              the performance of a supervised method based on convolutional
              neural networks, while avoiding some of the biases of such
              methods, and at much faster running times. We therefore recommend
              that spikes be inferred from calcium traces using simple NND, due
              to its simplicity, efficiency and accuracy.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENTThe experimental method that currently allows for
              recordings of the largest numbers of cells simultaneously is
              two-photon calcium imaging. However, use of this powerful method
              requires that neuronal firing times be inferred correctly from
              the large resulting datasets. Previous studies have claimed that
              complex supervised learning algorithms outperform simple
              deconvolution methods at this task. Unfortunately, these studies
              suffered from several problems and biases. When we repeated the
              analysis, using the same data and correcting these problems, we
              found that simpler spike inference methods perform better. Even
              more importantly, we found that supervised learning methods can
              introduce artifactual structure into spike trains, that can in
              turn lead to erroneous scientific conclusions. Of the algorithms
              we evaluated, we found that an extremely simple method performed
              best in all circumstances tested, was much faster to run, and was
              insensitive to parameter choices, making incorrect scientific

               CA1, a region critical for spatial learning. Studies of acute
               hippocampal slices from adult rats and mice show that for
               excitatory Schaffer--commissural projections, the memory-related
               long-term potentiation (LTP) effect depends upon endogenous
               estrogen and membrane estrogen receptor $\alpha$ (ER$\alpha$) in
               females but not in males; there was no evident involvement of
               nuclear ER$\alpha$ in females, or of ER$\beta$ or GPER1
               (G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1) in either sex.
               Quantitative immunofluorescence showed that stimulation-induced
               activation of two LTP-related kinases (Src, ERK1/2), and of
               postsynaptic TrkB, required ER$\alpha$ in females only, and that
               postsynaptic ER$\alpha$ levels are higher in females than in
               males. Several downstream signaling events involved in LTP were
               comparable between the sexes. In contrast to endogenous estrogen
               effects, infused estradiol facilitated LTP and synaptic
               signaling in females via both ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$. The
               estrogen dependence of LTP in females was associated with a
               higher threshold for both inducing potentiation and acquiring
               spatial information. These results indicate that the observed
               sexual dimorphism in hippocampal LTP reflects differences in
               synaptic kinase activation, including both a weaker association
               with NMDA receptors and a greater ER$\alpha$-mediated kinase
               activation in response to locally produced estrogen in females.
               We propose that male/female differences in mechanisms and
               threshold for field CA1 LTP contribute to differences in
               encoding specific types of memories.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There

               cognitive function, but the neurobiological basis for this
               sexual dimorphism is not understood. Here we describe sex
               differences in synaptic function in a brain area that is
               critical for learning spatial cues. Our results show that female
               rodents have higher synaptic levels of estrogen receptor
               $\alpha$ (ER$\alpha$) and, in contrast to males, require
               membrane ER$\alpha$ for the activation of signaling kinases that
               support long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic
               plasticity thought to underlie learning. The additional
               requirement of estrogen signaling in females resulted in a
               higher threshold for both LTP and hippocampal field
               CA1-dependent spatial learning. These results describe a

  abstract = "Summary The behavioral response to a sensory stimulus may depend
              on both learned and innate neuronal representations. How these
              circuits interact to produce appropriate behavior is unknown. In
              Drosophila, the lateral horn (LH) and mushroom body (MB) are
              thought to mediate innate and learned olfactory behavior,
              respectively, although LH function has not been tested directly.
              Here we identify two LH cell types (PD2a1 and PD2b1) that receive
              input from an MB output neuron required for recall of aversive
              olfactory memories. These neurons are required for aversive
              memory retrieval and modulated by training. Connectomics data
              demonstrate that PD2a1 and PD2b1 neurons also receive direct
              input from food odor-encoding neurons. Consistent with this,
              PD2a1 and PD2b1 are also necessary for unlearned attraction to
              some odors, indicating that these neurons have a dual behavioral
              role. This provides a circuit mechanism by which learned and
              innate olfactory information can interact in identified neurons
              to produce appropriate behavior.",

  abstract = "Estrogens signal through both nuclear and membrane receptors with
              most reported effects being mediated via the nuclear estrogen
              receptors (nERs). Although much work has been reported on nERs in
              the zebrafish, there is a lack of direct genetic evidence for
              their functional roles and importance in reproduction. To address
              this issue, we undertook this study to disrupt all three nERs in
              the zebrafish, namely esr1 (ER$\alpha$), esr2a (ER$\beta$II), and
              esr2b (ER$\beta$I), by the genome-editing technology clustered
              regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and its
              associated nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9). Using this loss-of-function
              genetic approach, we successfully created three mutant zebrafish
              lines with each nER knocked out. In addition, we also generated
              all possible double and triple knockouts of the three nERs. The
              phenotypes of these mutants in reproduction were analyzed in all
              single, double, and triple nER knockouts in both females and
              males. Surprisingly, all three single nER mutant fish lines
              display normal reproductive development and function in both
              females and males, suggesting functional redundancy among these
              nERs. Further analysis of double and triple knockouts showed that
              nERs, especially Esr2a and Esr2b, were essential for female
              reproduction, and loss of these two nERs led to an arrest of
              folliculogenesis at previtellogenic stage II followed by sex
              reversal from female to male. In addition, the current study also
              revealed a unique role for Esr2a in follicle cell proliferation
              and transdifferentiation, follicle growth, and chorion formation.
              Taken together, this study provides the most comprehensive

  abstract = "Spontaneous activity is a fundamental characteristic of the
              developing nervous system. Intriguingly, it often takes the form
              of multiple structured assemblies of neurons. Such assemblies can
              form even in the absence of afferent input, for instance in the
              zebrafish optic tectum after bilateral enucleation early in life.
              While the development of neural assemblies based on structured
              afferent input has been theoretically well-studied, it is less
              clear how they could arise in systems without afferent input.
              Here we show that a recurrent network of binary threshold neurons
              with initially random weights can form neural assemblies based on
              a simple Hebbian learning rule. Over development the network
              becomes increasingly modular while being driven by initially
              unstructured spontaneous activity, leading to the emergence of
              neural assemblies. Surprisingly, the set of neurons making up
              each assembly then continues to evolve, despite the number of
              assemblies remaining roughly constant. In the mature network
              assembly activity builds over several timesteps before the
              activation of the full assembly, as recently observed in

  abstract = "Responses of auditory cortical neurons encode sound features of
              incoming acoustic stimuli and also are shaped by stimulus context
              and history. Previous studies of mammalian auditory cortex have
              reported a variable time-course for such contextual effects
              ranging from milliseconds to minutes. However, in secondary
              auditory forebrain areas of songbirds, long-term
              stimulus-specific neuronal habituation to acoustic stimuli can
              persist for much longer periods of time, ranging from hours to
              days. Such long-term habituation in the songbird is a form of
              long-term auditory memory that requires gene expression. Although
              such long-term habituation has been demonstrated in avian
              auditory forebrain, this phenomenon has not previously been
              described in the mammalian auditory system. Utilizing a similar
              version of the avian habituation paradigm, we explored whether
              such long-term effects of stimulus history also occur in auditory
              cortex of a mammalian auditory generalist, the ferret. Following
              repetitive presentation of novel complex sounds, we observed
              significant response habituation in secondary auditory cortex,
              but not in A1 (primary auditory cortex). This long-term
              habituation appeared to be independent for each novel stimulus
              and often lasted for at least 20 minutes. These effects could not
              be explained by simple neuronal fatigue in the auditory pathway,
              since time-reversed sounds induced undiminished responses similar
              to those elicited by completely novel sounds. A parallel set of
              pupillometric response measurements in the ferret revealed
              long-term habituation effects similar to observed long-term
              neural habituation, supporting the hypothesis that habituation to
              passively presented stimuli is correlated with implicit learning
              and long-term recognition of familiar sounds.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENTLong-term habituation in higher areas of songbird
              auditory forebrain is associated with gene expression and is
              correlated with recognition memory. Similar long-term auditory
              habituation in mammals has not been previously described. We
              studied such habituation in single neurons in the auditory cortex
              of awake ferrets that were passively listening to repeated
              presentations of various complex sounds. Responses exhibited
              long-lasting habituation (at least 20 minutes) in the secondary,
              but not primary auditory cortex. Habituation ceased when stimuli
              were played backwards, despite having identical spectral content
              to the original sound. This long-term neural habituation
              correlated with similar habituation of ferret pupillary responses
              to repeated presentations of the same stimuli, suggesting that
              stimulus habituation is retained as a long-term behavioral
              memory.",

              review an emerging hypothesis that the evolutionary role of the
              superior colliculus (SC) in mammals or its homolog in birds, the
              optic tectum (OT), is to select the most salient target and send

              reveal mechanisms of how saliency is computed in the OT/SC,
              demonstrating a striking similarity between mammals and birds.
              The saliency of a target can be determined by how different it is
              from the surrounding objects, by how different it is from its
              history (that is habituation) and by how relevant it is for the

              embryonic brain development, but the results in humans remain
              controversial, the mechanisms involved are not well understood
              and effective therapies are yet to be designed. We hypothesize
              that some of the prenatal effects of cocaine might be related to
              dysregulation of physiological rhythms due to alterations in the
              integrating circadian clock function. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPLE
              FINDINGS: Here we introduce a new high-throughput genetically
              well-characterized diurnal vertebrate model for studying the
              mechanisms of prenatal cocaine effects by demonstrating reduced
              viability and alterations in the pattern of neuronal development
              following repeated cocaine exposure in zebrafish embryos. This
              effect is associated with acute cocaine-induced changes in the
              expression of genes affecting growth (growth hormone, zGH) and
              neurotransmission (dopamine transporter, zDAT). Analysis of
              circadian gene expression, using quantitative real-time RT-PCR
              (QPCR), demonstrates that cocaine acutely and dose-dependently
              changes the expression of the circadian genes (zPer-3, zBmal-1)
              and genes encoding melatonin receptors (zMelR) that mediate the
              circadian message to the entire organism. Moreover, the effects
              of prenatal cocaine depend on the time of treatment, being more
              robust during the day, independent of whether the embryos are
              raised under the light-dark cycle or in constant light. The
              latter suggests involvement of the inherited circadian factors.
              The principal circadian hormone, melatonin, counteracts the
              effects of cocaine on neuronal development and gene expression,
              acting via specific melatonin receptors.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that, in a
              diurnal vertebrate, prenatal cocaine can acutely dysregulate the
              expression of circadian genes and those affecting melatonin
              signaling, growth and neurotransmission, while repeated cocaine
              exposure can alter neuronal development. Daily variation in these
              effects of cocaine and their attenuation by melatonin suggest a
              potential prophylactic or therapeutic role for circadian factors
              in prenatal cocaine exposure.",

              cardiovascular physiology. Estrogens also activate the G
              protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), however the function of
              GPER in vivo is less well understood. Here we find that GPER is
              required for normal heart rate in zebrafish embryos. Acute
              exposure to estrogens increased heart rate in wildtype and in
              ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$ mutant embryos but not in GPER mutants.
              GPER mutant embryos exhibited reduced basal heart rate, while
              heart rate was normal in ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$ mutants. We
              detected gper transcript in discrete regions of the brain and
              pituitary but not in the heart, suggesting that GPER acts
              centrally to regulate heart rate. In the pituitary, we observed
              gper expression in cells that regulate levels of thyroid hormone
              triiodothyronine (T3), a hormone known to increase heart rate.
              Compared to wild type, GPER mutants had reduced levels of T3 and
              estrogens, suggesting pituitary abnormalities. Exposure to
              exogenous T3, but not estradiol, rescued the reduced heart rate
              phenotype in gper mutant embryos, demonstrating that T3 acts
              downstream of GPER to regulate heart rate. Using genetic and mass
              spectrometry approaches, we find that GPER regulates maternal
              estrogen levels, which are required for normal embryonic heart
              rate. Our results demonstrate that estradiol plays a previously
              unappreciated role in the acute modulation of heart rate during
              zebrafish embryonic development and suggest that GPER regulates

              Here we investigated the structural underpinnings of temporal
              integration in the larval zebrafish by first identifying
              integrator neurons using two-photon calcium imaging and then
              reconstructing the same neurons through serial electron

              neurons with activities highly correlated with eye position
              during spontaneous eye movements. Three morphological classes of
              neurons were observed: ipsilaterally projecting neurons located

              laterally, and a population at the extreme lateral edge of the

              Dendritic and synaptic organization of the ipsilaterally

              suppressed by experiencing predictive cues without punishment, a
              process called memory extinction. Here, we show that extinction

              sensory stimuli and select appropriate behavioral responses. When
              confronted with ambiguous stimuli, the brain is faced with the
              task of selecting one action while suppressing others. Although
              conceptually simple, the site and substrate of this elementary
              form of decision making is still largely unknown. Zebrafish
              larvae respond to a moving dot stimulus in either of two ways: a
              small object (potential prey) evokes approach, whereas a large
              object (potential predator) is avoided. The classification of
              object size relies on processing in the optic tectum. We
              genetically identified a population of cells, largely comprised
              of glutamatergic tectal interneurons with non-stratified
              morphologies, that are specifically required for approach toward
              small objects. When these neurons are ablated, we found that the
              behavioral response is shifted; small objects now tend to elicit
              avoidance. Conversely, optogenetic facilitation of neuronal
              responses with channelrhodopsin (ChR2) enhances approaches to
              small objects. Calcium imaging in head-fixed larvae shows that a
              large proportion of these neurons are tuned to small sizes. Their
              receptive fields are shaped by input from retinal ganglion cells
              (RGCs) that are selective for prey identity. We propose a model
              in which valence-based decisions arise, at a fundamental level,

  abstract = "The circuit mechanisms that give rise to direction selectivity in
              the retina have been studied extensively but how direction
              selectivity is established in retinorecipient areas of the brain
              is less well understood. Using functional imaging in larval
              zebrafish we examine how the direction of motion is encoded by
              populations of neurons at three layers of the optic tectum;
              retinal ganglion cell axons (RGCs), a layer of superficial
              inhibitory interneurons (SINs), and periventricular neurons
              (PVNs), which constitute the majority of neurons in the tectum.
              We show that the representation of motion direction is
              transformed at each layer. At the level of RGCs and SINs the
              direction of motion is encoded by three direction-selective (DS)
              subtypes tuned to upward, downward, and caudal-to-rostral motion.
              However, the tuning of SINs is significantly narrower and this
              leads to a conspicuous gap in the representation of motion in the
              rostral-to-caudal direction at the level of SINs. Consistent with
              previous findings we demonstrate that, at the level of PVNs the
              direction of motion is encoded by four DS cell types which
              include an additional DS PVN cell type tuned to rostral-to-caudal
              motion. Strikingly, the tuning profile of this emergent cell type
              overlaps with the gap in the representation of rostral-to-caudal
              motion at the level of SINs. Using our functional imaging data we
              constructed a simple computational model that demonstrates how
              the emergent population of PVNs is generated by the interactions
              of cells at each layer of the tectal network. The model predicts
              that PVNs tuned to rostral-to-caudal motion can be generated via
              convergence of DS RGCs tuned to upward and downward motion and
              feedforward tuned inhibition via SINs which suppresses responses
              to non-preferred directions. Thus, by reshaping directional
              tuning that is inherited from the retina inhibitory inputs from
              SINs can generate a novel subtype of DS PVN and in so doing
              enhance the encoding of directional stimuli.",

              segmentation is unclear since the amphioxus, the closest living
              invertebrate relative to the vertebrates, possesses a hindbrain
              homolog that displays no gross morphological segmentation. Three
              of the estrogen-receptor related (ERR) receptors are segmentally
              expressed in the zebrafish hindbrain, suggesting that their
              common ancestor was expressed in a similar, reiterated manner. We
              have also cloned and determined the developmental expression of
              the single homolog of the vertebrate ERR genes in the amphioxus
              (AmphiERR). This gene is also expressed in a segmented manner in
              a region considered homologous to the vertebrate hindbrain. In
              contrast to the expression of amphioxus islet (a LIM-homeobox
              gene that also labels motoneurons), AmphiERR expression persists
              longer in the hindbrain homolog and does not later extend to
              additional posterior cells. In addition, AmphiERR and one of its
              vertebrate homologs (ERRalpha) are expressed in the developing
              somitic musculature of amphioxus and zebrafish, respectively.
              Altogether, our results are consistent with fine structural
              evidence suggesting that the amphioxus hindbrain is segmented,
              and indicate that chordate ERR gene expression is a marker for
              both hindbrain and muscle segmentation. Furthermore, our data
              support an evolution model of chordate brain segmentation:
              originally, the program for anterior segmentation in the

              developing axial mesoderm which imposed reiterated patterning on
              the adjacent neural tube; during early vertebrate evolution, this

              combining spatial and temporal control, is cell-type specific,
              inducible, reversible, rapid and scaleable. Bacterial
              Nitroreductase (NTR) is used to catalyze the reduction of the

              tissue-specific promoter. Subsequent exposure to Mtz by adding it
              to the media induces cell death exclusively within NTR(+) cells.
              This approach can be applied to regeneration studies, as removing
              Mtz by washing permits tissue recovery. Using this protocol, cell

              A central question in locomotion lies in understanding which
              neural populations set locomotor frequency during slow and fast
              regimes. Tackling this question in vivo requires additional
              non-invasive tools to silence large populations of neurons during
              active locomotion. Here we generated a stable transgenic line
              encoding a zebrafish-optimized botulinum neurotoxin light chain
              fused to GFP (BoTxBLC-GFP) to silence synaptic output over large
              populations of motor neurons or interneurons while monitoring
              active locomotion. By combining calcium imaging,
              electrophysiology, optogenetics, and behavior, we show that
              expression of BoTxBLC-GFP abolished synaptic release while
              maintaining characterized activity patterns and without
              triggering off-target effects. As chx10(+) V2a interneurons
              (V2as) are well characterized as the main population driving the
              frequency-dependent recruitment of motor neurons during fictive

              the effect of silencing chx10(+) V2as during active and fictive
              locomotion. Silencing of V2as selectively abolished fast
              locomotor frequencies during escape responses. In addition,
              spontaneous slow locomotion occurred less often and at
              frequencies lower than in controls. Overall, this silencing
              approach confirms that V2a excitation is critical for the
              production of fast stimulus-evoked swimming and also reveals a
              role for V2a excitation in the production of slower spontaneous
              locomotor behavior. Altogether, these results establish
              BoTxBLC-GFP as an ideal tool for in vivo silencing for probing

              regulates cAMP levels via G-protein-dependent activation of

              tracking zebrafish allows for the quantification on movement of a
              single subject, and the delivery of the startle stimulus can be
              synchronized with the motion-detection software to obtain a high
              temporal resolution that is not provided by other means of
              motion-detection tracking. CONCLUSION: Objective techniques for
              evaluating these basic modifications of the startle response
              (pre-pulse and habituation) may be helpful in future behavioral
              analysis as this species is rapidly becoming among the most
              commonly utilized in preclinical pharmacological assessment.",

              saturated with information. However, animals must be particular
              to which stimuli they attend and those to ignore, as mistakes may

              response decrement of the jumping spider Trite planiceps. Jumping
              spiders are active visual hunters, and moving visual stimuli
              trigger a readily observable optomotor response. We used either
              an ISI of 10 or 20 s between 160 stimulus presentations,

              ability to precisely manipulate the zebrafish genome, much less
              is known about many aspects of learning and memory in adult fish.
              Here, we describe the development of a contextual fear
              conditioning paradigm using an electric shock as the aversive
              stimulus. We find that contextual fear conditioning is modulated
              by shock intensity, prevented by an established amnestic agent
              (MK-801), lasts at least 14 d, and exhibits extinction.
              Furthermore, fish of various background strains (AB, Tu, and TL)
              are able to acquire fear conditioning, but differ in fear
              extinction rates. Taken together, we find that contextual fear
              conditioning in zebrafish shares many similarities with the
              widely used contextual fear conditioning paradigm in rodents.
              Combined with the amenability of genetic manipulation in

  abstract = "During many behaviors in vertebrates, the central nervous system
              (CNS) generates asymmetric activities between the left and right
              sides to produce asymmetric body movements. For asymmetrical
              activations of the CNS, reciprocal inhibition between the left
              and right sides is believed to play a key role. However, the
              complexity of the CNS makes it difficult to identify the
              reciprocal inhibition circuits at the level of individual cells
              and the contribution of each neuron to the asymmetric activity.
              Using larval zebrafish, we examined this issue by investigating
              reciprocal inhibition circuits between a pair of Mauthner (M)
              cells, giant reticulospinal neurons that trigger fast escapes.
              Previous studies have shown that a class of excitatory neurons,
              called cranial relay neurons (CRNs), is involved in the
              reciprocal inhibition pathway between the M-cells. Using
              transgenic fish, in which two of the CRNs (Ta1 and Ta2) expressed
              GFP, we showed that Ta1 and Ta2 constitute major parts of the
              pathway. In larvae in which Ta1/Ta2 were laser-ablated, the
              amplitude of the reciprocal IPSPs dropped to less than one-third.
              Calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording showed that
              the occurrence probability of bilateral M-cell activation upon
              sound/vibration stimuli was greatly increased in the
              Ta1/Ta2-ablated larvae. Behavioral experiments revealed that the
              Ta1/Ta2 ablation resulted in shallower body bends during
              sound/vibration-evoked escapes, which is consistent with the
              observation that increased occurrence of bilateral M-cell

              components of the reciprocal inhibition circuits in the M-cell
              system and the behavioral importance of the circuits.Significance
              StatementsReciprocal inhibition between the left and right side
              of the CNS is considered imperative for producing asymmetric
              movements in animals. It has been difficult, however, to identify
              the circuits at the individual cell level and their role in
              behavior. Here, we address this problem by examining the
              reciprocal inhibition circuits of the hindbrain Mauthner (M) cell
              system in larval zebrafish. We determined that two paired
              interneurons play a critical role in the reciprocal inhibition
              between the paired M-cells and that the reciprocal inhibition
              prevents bilateral firing of the M-cells and is thus necessary
              for the full body-bend during M-cell-initiated escape. Further,
              we discussed the cooperation of multiple reciprocal inhibitions
              working in the hindbrain and spinal cord to ensure
              high-performance escapes.",

              data from many animals. The resulting data are often complex in
              structure and are subjected to systematic biases, which require
              new approaches for analysis and normalization. This study
              addressed the normalization need by establishing an approach
              based on linear-regression modeling. The model was established
              using a dataset of visual motor response (VMR) obtained from
              several strains of wild-type (WT) zebrafish collected at multiple
              stages of development. The VMR is a locomotor response triggered
              by drastic light change, and is commonly measured repeatedly from
              multiple larvae arrayed in 96-well plates. This assay is
              subjected to several systematic variations. For example, the
              light emitted by the machine varies slightly from well to well.
              In addition to the light-intensity variation, biological
              replication also created batch-batch variation. These systematic
              variations may result in differences in the VMR and must be
              normalized. Our normalization approach explicitly modeled the
              effect of these systematic variations on VMR. It also normalized
              the activity profiles of different conditions to a common
              baseline. Our approach is versatile, as it can incorporate
              different normalization needs as separate factors. The
              versatility was demonstrated by an integrated normalization of
              three factors: light-intensity variation, batch-batch variation
              and baseline. After normalization, new biological insights were
              revealed from the data. For example, we found larvae of TL strain
              at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) responded to light onset much
              stronger than the 9-dpf larvae, whereas previous analysis without
              normalization shows that their responses were relatively
              comparable. By removing systematic variations, our model-based
              normalization can facilitate downstream statistical comparisons
              and aid detecting true biological differences in high-throughput
              studies of neurobehaviour.",

              networks. It exerts many of its effects through GABAA receptors,
              which are heteropentamers assembled from a large array of
              subunits encoded by distinct genes. In mammals, there are 19
              different GABAA subunit types, which are divided into the
              $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\epsilon$, $\pi$,
              $\vartheta$ and $\rho$ subfamilies. The immense diversity of
              GABAA receptors is not fully understood. However, it is known
              that specific isoforms, with their distinct biophysical
              properties and expression profiles, tune responses to GABA.
              Although larval zebrafish are well-established as a model system
              for neural circuit analysis, little is known about GABAA
              receptors diversity and expression in this system. Here, using
              database analysis, we show that the zebrafish genome contains at
              least 23 subunits. All but the mammalian $\vartheta$ and
              $\epsilon$ subunits have at least one zebrafish ortholog, while
              five mammalian GABAA receptor subunits have two zebrafish
              orthologs. Zebrafish contain one subunit, $\beta$4, which does
              not have a clear mammalian ortholog. Similar to mammalian GABAA
              receptors, the zebrafish $\alpha$ subfamily is the largest and
              most diverse of the subfamilies. In zebrafish there are eight
              $\alpha$ subunits, and RNA in situ hybridization across early
              zebrafish development revealed that they demonstrate distinct
              patterns of expression in the brain, spinal cord, and retina.
              Some subunits were very broadly distributed, whereas others were
              restricted to small populations of cells. Subunit-specific
              expression patterns in zebrafish resembled were those found in
              frogs and rodents, which suggests that the roles of different
              GABAA receptor isoforms are largely conserved among vertebrates.
              This study provides a platform to examine isoform specific roles
              of GABAA receptors within zebrafish neural circuits and it

              states such as arousal. This dependence is seen both in primary
              visual cortex (V1) and in subcortical brain structures receiving
              direct retinal input. Here we show that this effect arises as
              early as in the output of the retina. We first measured activity
              in a region that receives retinal projections, the superficial
              superior colliculus (sSC), and found that this activity strongly
              depended on behavioural state. This modulation was not mediated
              by feedback inputs from V1 as it was immune to V1 inactivation.
              We then used Neuropixels probes to record activity in the optic
              tract, and we found some retinal axons whose activity
              significantly varied with arousal, even in darkness. To
              characterize these effects on a larger sample of retinal outputs,
              we imaged the activity of retinal boutons in sSC during behaviour

              reveal a novel property of retinal function in mice, which could
              be observed only during behaviour: retinal outputs are modulated

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The processing of optic flow in the
              pretectum/accessory optic system allows animals to stabilize
              retinal images by executing compensatory optokinetic and
              optomotor behavior. The success of this behavior depends on the
              integration of information from both eyes to unequivocally
              identify all possible translational or rotational directions of
              motion. However, it is still unknown whether the precise
              direction of ego-motion is already identified in the zebrafish
              pretectum or later in downstream premotor areas. RESULTS: Here,
              we show that the zebrafish pretectum and tectum each contain four
              populations of motion-sensitive direction-selective (DS) neurons,
              with each population encoding a different preferred direction
              upon monocular stimulation. In contrast, binocular stimulation
              revealed the existence of pretectal and tectal neurons that are
              specifically tuned to only one of the many possible combinations
              of monocular motion, suggesting that further downstream sensory
              processing might not be needed to instruct appropriate
              optokinetic and optomotor behavior. CONCLUSION: Our results
              suggest that local, task-specific pretectal circuits process DS
              retinal inputs and carry out the binocular sensory computations

              organisms may also respond to mutations by transcriptional

              patterns. The properties and functions of INs in the developing
              OB are, however, not well understood. We studied the functional
              development of INs in the OB of living zebrafish larvae 3-6 days
              postfertilization using anatomical techniques and in-vivo
              two-photon Ca2+ imaging. We identified MCs and INs by
              cell-type-specific expression of transgenic fluorescent markers
              and found that the IN:MC ratio was lower than in the adult fish.
              Moreover, the fraction of INs responding with Ca2+ signals to a
              set of natural odors was substantially lower than in adults.
              Odors of different chemical classes evoked overlapping patterns

              layer. The GABA(A) receptor agonists GABA and muscimol strongly

              signaling is already inhibitory at early stages of OB development

              describe a novel strategy to isolate seizure-resistant zebrafish
              mutants from a large-scale mutagenesis screen. METHODS: Seizures
              were induced with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Zebrafish were
              analyzed between 3 and 7 days postfertilization (dpf). Genome
              mutations were induced in founders by using N-ethyl-nitrosourea
              (ENU). Seizure behavior was monitored by using a high-speed
              camera and quantified by locomotion-tracking software.
              Electrographic activity was monitored by using a field-recording
              electrode placed in the optic tectum of agar-immobilized
              zebrafish. RESULTS: Short-term PTZ exposure elicited a
              burst-suppression seizure pattern in 3-dpf zebrafish and more
              complex activity consisting of interictal- and ictal-like

               paradigm to study these behavioral state transitions at
               cellular-resolution across the entire vertebrate brain. Using
               brainwide imaging in zebrafish, we observed that the transition

  abstract = "Genetic approaches in Drosophila have advanced our understanding
              of the molecular mechanisms of different forms of learning,
              including habituation, but relevant neural components have not
              been explored. We show that a well defined neural circuit that
              underlies an escape response can be habituated, providing for the
              first time excellent opportunities for studying physiological
              parameters of learning in a functional circuit in the fly.
              Compared with other forms of conditioning, relatively little is
              known of the physiological mechanisms of habituation. The giant
              fiber pathway mediates a jump-and-flight escape response to
              visual stimuli. The jump may also be triggered electrically at
              multiple sites in the tethered fly. This response shows
              parameters of habituation, including frequency-dependent decline
              in responsiveness, spontaneous recovery, and dishabituation by a
              novel stimulus, attributable to plasticity in the brain.
              Mutations of rutabaga that diminish cAMP synthesis reduced the
              rate of habituation, whereas dunce mutations that increase cAMP
              levels led to a detectable but moderate increase in habituation
              rates. Surprisingly, habituation was extremely rapid in dunce
              rutabaga double mutants. This corresponds to the extreme defects
              seen in double mutants in other learning tasks, and demonstrates
              that defects of the rutabaga and dunce products interact
              synergistically in ways that could not have been predicted on the
              basis of simple counterbalancing biochemical effects. Although
              habituation is localized to afferents to the giant fiber, cAMP
              mutations also affected performance of thoracic portions of the
              pathway on a millisecond time scale that did not account for
              behavioral plasticity. More significantly, spontaneous recovery
              and dishabituation were not as clearly affected as habituation in
              mutants, indicating that these processes may not overlap entirely
              in terms of cAMP-regulating mechanisms. The analysis of
              habituation of the giant fiber response in available learning and
              memory mutants could be a crucial step toward realizing the
              promise of memory mutations to elucidate mechanisms in neural

              genotype-phenotype annotations, gene ontologies and interaction
              networks to determine the clinical features and molecular
              processes that are associated with habituation deficits. Results:
              We identified more than 100 genes required for habituation
              learning. For the vast majority of these, 93 genes, a role in
              habituation learning was previously unknown. These genes
              characterize ID disorders with macrocephaly/overgrowth and
              comorbid ASD. Moreover, ASD individuals from the Simons Simplex
              Collection (SSC) carrying damaging de novo mutations in these
              genes exhibit increased aberrant behaviors associated with
              inappropriate, stereotypic speech. At the molecular level, ID
              genes required for normal habituation are enriched in synaptic
              function and converge on Ras-MAPK signaling. Both increased
              Ras-MAPK signaling in GABAergic and decreased Ras-MAPK signaling
              in cholinergic neurons specifically inhibit the adaptive
              habituation response. Conclusions: Our work supports the
              relevance of habituation learning to autism, identifies an
              unprecedented number of novel habituation players, supports an
              emerging role for inhibitory neurons in habituation and reveals
              an opposing, circuit-level-based mechanism for Ras-MAPK
              signaling. This establishes habituation as a possible, widely
              applicable functional readout and target for pharmacologic
              intervention in ID/ASD.",

  abstract = "Habituation is a simple form of learning where animals learn to
              reduce their responses to repeated innocuous stimuli [1].
              Habituation is thought to occur via at least two temporally and
              molecularly distinct mechanisms, which lead to short-term
              memories that last for seconds to minutes and long-term memories
              that last for hours or longer [1, 2]. Here, we focus on long-term
              habituation, which, due to the extended time course, necessitates
              stable alterations to circuit properties [2-4]. In its simplest
              form, long-term habituation could result from a plasticity event
              at a single point in a circuit, and many studies have focused on
              identifying the site and underlying mechanism of plasticity
              [5-10]. However, it is possible that these individual sites are
              only one of many points in the circuit where plasticity is
              occurring. Indeed, studies of short-term habituation in C.
              elegans indicate that in this paradigm, multiple genetically
              separable mechanisms operate to adapt specific aspects of
              behavior [11-13]. Here, we use a visual assay in which larval
              zebrafish habituate their response to sudden reductions in
              illumination (dark flashes) [14, 15]. Through behavioral
              analyses, we find that multiple components of the dark-flash
              response habituate independently of one another using different
              molecular mechanisms. This is consistent with a modular model in
              which habituation originates from multiple independent processes,
              each adapting specific components of behavior. This may allow
              animals to more specifically or flexibly habituate based on
              stimulus context or internal states.",

              required, thereby linking pathological molecular effects with
              impaired function and organismic behavior. Because cerebellar
              anatomy and function are evolutionary conserved, zebrafish

              STATEMENTSCA13 patients carrying a KCNC3R420H allele have been
              shown to display mid- onset progressive cerebellar atrophy, but
              genetic modeling of SCA13 by expressing this pathogenic mutant in
              different animal models has not resulted in neuronal degeneration
              so far - likely because the transgene was expressed in
              heterologous cell types. We developed a genetic system for
              tunable PC specific coexpression of several transgenes to
              manipulate and simultaneously monitor cerebellar PCs. We modeled
              a SCA13 zebrafish accessible for bio-imaging to investigate
              disease progression, revealing robust PC degeneration, resulting
              in impaired eye movement. Our transgenic zebrafish mimicking both
              neuropathological and behavioral changes manifested in
              SCA-affected patients will be suitable for investigating causes

  abstract = "Eye-specific patches or stripes normally develop in the visual
              cortex and superior colliculus of many (but not all) mammals and
              are also formed, after surgically produced binocular innervation,
              in the optic tectum of fish and frogs. The segregation of ocular
              dominance patches or columns has been studied using a variety of
              anatomical pathway-tracing techniques, by electrophysiological
              recording of postsynaptic units or field potentials, and by the
              2-deoxyglucose method following visual stimulation of only one
              eye. In the tectum of both fish and frogs and in the cortex and
              colliculus of mammals, eye-specific patches develop from
              initially diffuse, overlapping projections. Of the various
              mechanisms that might cause such segregation, the evidence favors
              an activity-dependent process that stabilizes synapses from the
              same eye because of their correlated activity. First, several
              environmental manipulations affect the segregation of afferents
              in visual cortex: strabismus and alternate monocular exposure
              apparently enhance segregation, whereas dark rearing slows the
              segregation process, and monocular deprivation causes the
              experienced eye to form larger patches at the expense of those of
              the deprived eye. Second, blocking activity in both eyes is
              effective in preventing the segregation both in the tectum of
              fish and frog and in the visual cortex of cat. With the eyes
              blocked, alternate stimulation of the optic nerves permits the
              segregation of ocular dominance, at least onto single cells in
              the cat visual cortex. These findings are discussed in terms of
              an activity-dependent stabilization of those synapses having
              correlated activity (those from neighboring ganglion cells within
              one eye) but not of those lacking correlated activity (those from
              left and right eyes). We suggest that the eye-specific patches
              represent a compromise between total segregation of the
              projections from the two eyes and the formation of a single
              continuous retinotopic map across the surface of the cortex or

               promote the continuation and completion of such action sequences
               are not well understood. Here, we characterize the anatomy,
               physiology, and function of the nucleus isthmi (NI), a
               cholinergic nucleus thought to modulate tectal-dependent,
               goal-directed behaviors. We find that the larval zebrafish NI
               establishes reciprocal connectivity with the optic tectum and
               identify two distinct types of isthmic projection neuron that
               either connect ipsilaterally to retinorecipient laminae of the

               Laser ablation of NI caused highly specific deficits in tectally

               context of hunting, NI ablation did not affect prey detection or

               prey-tracking sequences and aborting their hunting routines.
               Moreover, calcium imaging revealed elevated neural activity in

              Zebrafish possess two agrp genes: hypothalamically expressed
              agrp1, considered functionally equivalent to the single mammalian
              agrp, and agrp2, which is expressed in pre-optic neurons and

              the circuit basis of feeding and related behaviors is an
              important goal in neuroscience. We recently used a system for
              closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of neurons contingent on the

              describe the development and validation of this system, which we
              term the optoPAD. We use the optoPAD to induce appetitive and
              aversive effects on feeding by activating or inhibiting gustatory
              neurons in closed-loop - effectively creating virtual taste
              realities. The use of optogenetics allowed us to vary the
              dynamics and probability of stimulation in single flies and
              assess the impact on feeding behavior quantitatively and with
              high throughput. These data demonstrate that the optoPAD is a

              question is how the responses to these diverse variables are
              organized across the population of dopamine neurons. Whether
              individual dopamine neurons multiplex several variables, or
              whether there are subsets of neurons that are specialized in
              encoding specific behavioural variables remains unclear. This
              fundamental question has been difficult to resolve because
              recordings from large populations of individual dopamine neurons
              have not been performed in a behavioural task with sufficient
              complexity to examine these diverse variables simultaneously.
              Here, to address this gap, we used two-photon calcium imaging
              through an implanted lens to record the activity of more than 300
              dopamine neurons from the ventral tegmental area of the mouse
              midbrain during a complex decision-making task. As mice navigated
              in a virtual-reality environment, dopamine neurons encoded an

              spatially organized, with neighbouring neurons more likely to be
              part of the same cluster. Together with the topography between
              dopamine neurons and their projections, this specialization and

              Some theories have proposed that one form of memory, habituation,
              is particularly impaired. Preliminary evidence suggests memory
              impairment is associated with failed hippocampal habituation in
              chronic schizophrenia patients. Here, we studied how abnormal
              habituation of the hippocampus is related to relational memory
              deficits in the early stage of psychosis. Methods We measured
              hippocampal activity in 62 patients with early psychosis and 70
              healthy individuals using fMRI. Habituation was defined as the
              slope of fMRI signal change to repeated presentations of faces
              and objects. Relational memory ability was measured as the slope
              of preferential viewing during a face-scene pair eye movement
              task outside the scanner. Results Early psychosis patients showed
              impaired relational memory (p < 0.001) and less hippocampal
              habituation to objects (p = 0.01) than healthy control subjects.
              In the healthy control group, better relational memory was
              associated with faster anterior hippocampal habituation (faces, r
              = -0.28, p = 0.03). In contrast, early psychosis patients showed
              no brain-behavior relationship (r = 0.12, p = 0.40). Conclusions
              We found evidence for disrupted hippocampal habituation in the
              early stage of psychosis, along with an altered association
              between hippocampal habituation and relational memory ability.
              These results suggest neural habituation may provide a novel

              of the following decades, including the discovery of long-term

              more recently the residence of memories in synaptically connected
              neuronal assemblies. Our understanding of the processes
              underlying learning and memory has been dominated by the view
              that synapses are the principal site of information storage in
              the brain. This view has received substantial support from

              a diverse variety of nonreproductive social behaviors that emerge

              used it to probe behavior in a critical window of larval

              we took advantage of the optical transparency still preserved in

              robust assay to physically transect the larval optic nerve and
              find that by 96 hours post injury RGC axons have robustly regrown
              onto the optic tectum. We observe functional regeneration by 8
              days post injury, and demonstrate that similar to adult
              zebrafish, optic nerve transection in larval zebrafish does not
              prominently induce cell death or proliferation of RGC neurons.
              Furthermore, we find that partial optic nerve transection results

  abstract = "The study of fish escape responses has provided important
              insights into the accelerative motions and fast response times of
              these animals. In addition, the accessibility of the underlying
              neural circuits has made the escape response a fundamental model
              in neurobiology. Fish escape responses were originally viewed as
              highly stereotypic all-or-none behaviours. However, research on a
              wide variety of species has shown considerable taxon-specific and
              context-dependent variability in the kinematics and neural
              control of escape. In addition, escape-like motions have been
              reported: these resemble escape responses kinematically, but
              occur in situations that do not involve a response to a
              threatening stimulus. This Review focuses on the diversity of
              escape responses in fish by discussing recent work on: (1) the
              types of escape responses as defined by kinematic analysis (these
              include C- and S-starts, and single- versus double-bend
              responses); (2) the diversity of neuromuscular control; (3) the
              variability of escape responses in terms of behaviour and
              kinematics within the context of predator-prey interactions; and
              (4) the main escape-like motions observed in various species.
              Here, we aim to integrate recent knowledge on escape responses
              and highlight rich areas for research. Rapidly developing
              approaches for studying the kinematics of swimming motion both in
              the lab and within the natural environment provide new avenues
              for research on these critical and common behaviours.",

  abstract = "Summary Stabilizing gaze and position within an environment
              constitutes an important task for the nervous system of many
              animals. The optomotor response (OMR) is a reflexive behavior,
              present across many species, in which animals move in the
              direction of perceived whole-field visual motion, therefore
              stabilizing themselves with respect to the visual environment.
              Although the OMR has been extensively used to probe visuomotor
              neuronal circuitry, the exact visual cues that elicit the
              behavior remain unidentified. In this study, we use larval
              zebrafish to identify spatiotemporal visual features that
              robustly elicit forward OMR swimming. These cues consist of a
              local, forward-moving, off edge together with on/off symmetric,

              neural units specifically activated by the forward-moving

  abstract = "Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecules (dscam and dscaml1) are
              essential regulators of neural circuit assembly, but their roles
              in vertebrate neural circuit function are still mostly
              unexplored. We investigated the functional consequences of
              dscaml1 deficiency in the larval zebrafish (sexually
              undifferentiated) oculomotor system, where behavior, circuit
              function, and neuronal activity can be precisely quantified.
              Genetic perturbation of dscaml1 resulted in deficits in retinal
              patterning and light adaptation, consistent with its known roles
              in mammals. Oculomotor analyses revealed specific deficits
              related to the dscaml1 mutation, including severe fatigue during
              gaze stabilization, reduced saccade amplitude and velocity in the
              light, greater disconjugacy, and impaired fixation. Two-photon
              calcium imaging of abducens neurons in control and dscaml1 mutant
              animals confirmed deficits in saccade-command signals (indicative
              of an impairment in the saccadic premotor pathway), while
              abducens activation by the pretectum-vestibular pathway was not
              affected. Together, we show that loss of dscaml1 resulted in
              impairments in specific oculomotor circuits, providing a new
              animal model to investigate the development of oculomotor
              premotor pathways and their associated human ocular
              disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDscaml1 is a neural developmental
              gene with unknown behavioral significance. Using the zebrafish
              model, this study shows that dscaml1 mutants have a host of
              oculomotor (eye movement) deficits. Notably, the oculomotor
              phenotypes in dscaml1 mutants are reminiscent of human ocular
              motor apraxia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
              reduced saccade amplitude and gaze stabilization deficits.
              Population-level recording of neuronal activity further revealed
              potential subcircuit-specific requirements for dscaml1 during
              oculomotor behavior. These findings underscore the importance of
              dscaml1 in the development of visuomotor function and
              characterize a new model to investigate potential circuit

              we lack methods to identify them. To address this gap, we
              developed an unsupervised method to identify internal states from
              behavioral data and applied it to a dynamic social interaction.
              During courtship, Drosophila melanogaster males pattern their
              songs using feedback cues from their partner. Our model uncovers
              three latent states underlying this behavior and is able to
              predict moment-to-moment variation in song-patterning decisions.
              These states correspond to different sensorimotor strategies,
              each of which is characterized by different mappings from
              feedback cues to song modes. We show that a pair of neurons

              sufficient to drive switching between states. Our results reveal

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The oculomotor integrator (OI) in the vertebrate
              hindbrain transforms eye velocity input into persistent position
              coding output, which plays a crucial role in retinal image
              stability. For a mechanistic understanding of the integrator
              function and eye position control, knowledge about the tuning of
              the OI and other oculomotor nuclei is needed. Zebrafish are
              increasingly used to study integrator function and sensorimotor
              circuits, yet the precise neuronal tuning to motor variables
              remains uncharacterized. RESULTS: Here, we recorded cellular
              calcium signals while evoking monocular and binocular optokinetic
              eye movements at different slow-phase eye velocities. Our
              analysis reveals the anatomical distributions of motoneurons and
              internuclear neurons in the nucleus abducens as well as those of
              oculomotor neurons in caudally adjacent hindbrain volumes. Each
              neuron is tuned to eye position and/or velocity to variable
              extents and is only activated after surpassing particular eye
              position and velocity thresholds. While the abducens (rhombomeres
              5/6) mainly codes for eye position, in rhombomeres 7/8, a
              velocity-to-position coding gradient exists along the
              rostro-caudal axis, which likely corresponds to the oculomotor
              structures storing velocity and position, and is in agreement
              with a feedforward mechanism of persistent activity generation.
              Position encoding neurons are recruited at eye position
              thresholds distributed across the behaviourally relevant dynamic
              range, while velocity-encoding neurons have more centred firing
              thresholds for velocity. In the abducens, neurons coding
              exclusively for one eye intermingle with neurons coding for both
              eyes. Many of these binocular neurons are preferentially active
              during conjugate eye movements and less active during monocular
              eye movements. This differential recruitment during monocular
              versus conjugate tasks represents a functional diversification in
              the final common motor pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We localized and
              functionally characterized the repertoire of oculomotor neurons
              in the zebrafish hindbrain. Our findings provide evidence for a
              mixed but task-specific binocular code and suggest that
              generation of persistent activity is organized along the

              response. Repeated stimulus presentation is a feature of the
              standard procedure for classical conditioning, although, in this
              case, subjects experience repeated presentations of 2 stimuli
              occurring in sequence: S1-S2. We ask how habituation to each of
              these stimuli (S1 and S2) is influenced by this form of
              sequential presentation and what implications any effects might
              have for the understanding of both conditioning and habituation

              clear effect on habituation to S2 of preceding this stimulus with
              S1. Habituation to S1, however, is attenuated or prevented by the
              occurrence of S2: Some orienting responses are maintained when S2
              follows S1 inconsistently; other responses (habituation of which

               that events that are associatively signaled by discrete cues are
               not as effectively processed as they otherwise would be.
               Extrapolating from early evidence of this phenomenon, especially
               so-called conditioned diminution of the unconditioned response
               (CDUR), Wagner (1976, 1979) suggested that a similar effect
               might be responsible for long-term habituation, as stimuli come
               to be ``expected'' in the context in which they have been
               exposed. In this paper we will reflect upon this reasoning in
               the light of more recent evidence from our laboratory and
               elsewhere. One major complication is that extended contexts (as
               well as discrete cues) can control response-potentiating,
               conditioned-emotional tendencies, in addition to the presumed
               decremental effects. Experiments that separate these effects
               will be exemplified, and one theoretical approach, through the
               models SOP and AESOP (Wagner, 1981; Wagner \& Brandon, 1989)
               will be illustrated, with some implications for our further
               understanding of habituation.In the late 1970s, Wagner (1976;
               1979) presented some views about associative learning that were
               centered upon the notion that events that are already
               represented, or ``primed'' in active memory, are not as
               effectively processed as they otherwise would be. One of several
               forms of evidence for this supposition was the so-called
               conditioned diminution of the UR, a phenomenon originally

               two persistent internal states during foraging for live prey
               (Paramecia). In the exploitation state, the animal inhibits
               locomotion and promotes hunting, generating small, localized

               locomotion and suppresses hunting, generating long-ranging
               trajectories that enhance spatial dispersion. We uncover a
               dorsal raphe subpopulation with persistent activity that

               leads to marked changes in both the motivation to hunt for prey
               and the accuracy of motor sequences during hunting. This work
               reveals an important hidden variable that shapes the temporal

               We find global, recurring dynamics of brain states to exhibit
               pre-motor bifurcations toward mutually exclusive decision
               outcomes. These dynamics arise from a distributed network

               particularly strong and predictive pre-motor activity (>10 s

              stabilize gaze, in particular in small aquatic vertebrates where
              coordinated locomotor activity appears very early, is determined
              by assembly and functional maturation of inner ear structures and
              associated sensory-motor circuitries [3-7]. Whereas
              utriculo-ocular reflexes become functional immediately after
              hatching [8, 9], semicircular canal-dependent vestibulo-ocular
              reflexes (VORs) appear later [10]. Thus, small semicircular
              canals are unable to detect swimming-related head oscillations,
              despite the fact that corresponding acceleration components are
              well-suited to trigger an angular VOR [11]. This leaves the
              utricle as the sole vestibular origin for swimming-related
              compensatory eye movements [12, 13]. We report a remarkable
              ontogenetic plasticity of swimming-related head kinematics and
              vestibular end organ recruitment in Xenopus tadpoles with
              beneficial consequences for gaze-stabilization. Swimming of older
              larvae generates sinusoidal head undulations with small, similar
              curvature angles on the left and right side that optimally
              activate horizontal semicircular canals. Young larvae swimming
              causes left-right head undulations with narrow curvatures and
              strong, bilaterally dissimilar centripetal acceleration
              components well suited to activate utricular hair cells and to
              substitute the absent semicircular canal function at this stage.
              The capacity of utricular signals to supplant semicircular canal
              function was confirmed by recordings of eye movements and
              extraocular motoneurons during off-center rotations in control

              curvature angles and thus linear acceleration profiles during
              swimming in young larvae therefore represents a technically
              elegant solution to compensate for the incapacity of small

              fish modulate their tail movements along a continuum. During prey
              capture, larvae produce stereotyped sequences using a subset of
              bouts from a broader behavioral repertoire. These sequences
              exhibit low-order transition dynamics and immediately respond to
              changes in visual cues. Chaining of prey capture bouts is
              disrupted in visually impaired (lakritz and blumenkohl) mutants,

              occurs within the first few days of life when fish transition
              from coiling movements to burst swimming and then to
              beat-and-glide swimming. This maturation occurs against a
              backdrop of numerous developmental changes - neurogenesis, a
              transition from predominantly electrical to chemical-based
              neurotransmission, and refinement of intrinsic properties. There
              is evidence that spinal locomotor circuits undergo fundamental
              changes as the zebrafish transitions from burst to beat-and-glide
              swimming. Our electrophysiological recordings confirm that the
              operation of spinal locomotor circuits becomes increasingly
              reliant upon glycinergic neurotransmission for rhythmogenesis
              governing the rhythm of tail beats. This transition occurred at
              the same time that we observed a change in rhythmicity of
              synaptic inhibition to spinal motoneurons. When we examined
              whether the transition from weakly to strongly glycinergic
              dependent rhythmogenesis occurred at a uniform pace across the
              length of the spinal cord, we found that this transition occurred
              earlier at caudal segments than at rostral segments of the spinal
              cord. Furthermore, while this rhythmogenic transition occurred
              when fish transition from burst swimming to beat-and-glide
              swimming, these two transitions were not interdependent. These
              results suggest that there is a developmental transition in the
              operation of spinal locomotor circuits that is gradually set in
              place in the spinal cord in a caudo-rostral temporal
              sequence.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The neural circuits controlling
              movements must adapt to the development of the body to enable
              more refined and complex movements. Our results confirm a
              time-window in which the mechanisms for generating the rhythm
              driving tail beats in developing zebrafish shift from weakly
              relying upon synaptic inhibition to becoming strongly dependent
              upon synaptic inhibition. Surprisingly, this transition occurs at
              different developmental time points along the length of the
              spinal cord, in a direction opposite to the direction of growth
              of the body. Our findings emphasize that the maturation of motor
              control by the nervous system results from fundamental changes in
              the operation of the spinal circuits that underlie these

              neuroscience but its ultimate function remains surprisingly
              unclear: An actual survival value of M cell-mediated escapes has
              never been supported experimentally and ablating the cell
              repeatedly failed to eliminate all rapid escapes, suggesting that
              escapes can equally well be driven by smaller neurons. Here we
              applied techniques to simultaneously measure escape performance
              and the state of the giant M axon over an extended period
              following ablation of its soma. We discovered that the axon
              survives remarkably long and remains still fully capable of

              the two M axons and comparing escapes in the same individual that

              function in the retina across behavioral, physiological, and
              anatomical levels. Methods: Inhibitory neurons were ablated in
              larval zebrafish retina. The Ptf1a gene, which determines
              inhibitory neuron fate in developing vertebrates, was used to
              express nitroreductase. By exposing larvae to the prodrug
              metronidazole, cytotoxicity was selectively induced in inhibitory
              neurons. Visual phenotypes were characterized at behavioral,
              physiological, and anatomical levels using an optomotor response
              (OMR) assay, electroretinography (ERG), and routine histology,
              respectively. Nonvisual locomotion was also assessed to reveal
              any general behavioral effects due to ablation of other nonvisual
              neurons that also express Ptf1a. Results: Injured larvae showed
              severely reduced OMR relative to controls. Locomotor assessment
              showed unaltered swimming ability, indicating that reduced OMR
              was due to visual deficits. For ERG, injured larvae manifested
              either reduced (type-I) or absent (type-II) b-wave signals
              originating from bipolar interneurons in the retina. Histologic
              analysis showed altered retinal morphology in injured larvae,
              with reductions in synaptic inner plexiform layer (IPL) thickness
              and synaptic density more pronounced in type-II than type-I
              larvae; type-II larvae also had smaller retinae overall.
              Conclusions: The consequences of inhibitory neuron ablation
              corresponded closely across behavioral, physiological, and
              anatomical levels. Inhibitory neuron loss likely increases the
              ratio of neural excitation to inhibition, leading to
              hyperexcitability. In addition to modulating visual signals,
              inhibitory neurons may be critical for maintaining retinal
              structure and organization. This study highlights the utility of

              approaches are limited to incomplete parallelization in only two
              dimensions or sparse sampling in three dimensions. We hereby
              develop a novel fluorescence imaging approach, called coded
              light-sheet array microscopy (CLAM), which allows complete
              parallelized 3D imaging without mechanical scanning. Harnessing
              the concept of an ``infinity mirror'', CLAM generates a
              light-sheet array with controllable sheet density and degree of
              coherence. Thus, CLAM circumvents the common complications of
              multiple coherent light-sheet generation in terms of dedicated
              wavefront engineering and mechanical dithering/scanning.
              Moreover, the encoding of multiplexed optical sections in CLAM
              allows the synchronous capture of all sectioned images within the
              imaged volume. We demonstrate the utility of CLAM in different
              imaging scenarios, including a light-scattering medium, an
              optically cleared tissue, and microparticles in fluidic flow.
              CLAM can maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and the spatial duty
              cycle, and also provides a further reduction in photobleaching
              compared to the major scanning-based 3D imaging systems. The
              flexible implementation of CLAM regarding both hardware and

              proteostasis-in the brain, but the mechanism of this link has not

              slow swims for prey capture and exploration by activation of
              secondary motor neurons and much faster and vigorous swims during
              escape and struggle via additional activation of primary motor
              neurons. Neuromodulators are known to alter the motor output of
              spinal circuits, but their precise role in speed regulation is
              not well understood. Here, in the context of optomotor response
              (OMR), an innate evoked locomotor behavior, we show that dopamine
              (DA) provides an additional layer to regulation of swim speed in

              speed during OMR in free-swimming larvae. By analyzing tail bend

              recordings from motor neurons reveal that, during OMR, typically
              only secondary motor neurons are active, whereas primary motor
              neurons are quiescent. Activation of D1-like receptors increases
              intrinsic excitability and excitatory synaptic drive in primary

               LPAR6) have been discovered and each one of them can connect to
               the downstream cell message-transmitting network. A previous

               functions of LPAR3 were identified through extensive behavioral
               tests in lpar3 knockout (KO) zebrafish. It was found that the
               adult lpar3 KO zebrafish display an abnormal movement
               orientation and altered exploratory behavior compared to that of
               the control group in the three-dimensional locomotor and novel
               tank tests, respectively. Furthermore, consistent with those
               results, in the circadian rhythm locomotor activity test, the
               lpar3 KO zebrafish showed a lower level of angular velocity and
               average speed during the light cycles, indicating an
               hyperactivity-like behavior. In addition, the mutant fish also
               exhibited considerably higher locomotor activity during the dark
               cycle. Supporting those findings, this phenomenon was also
               displayed in the lpar3 KO zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, several
               important behavior alterations were also observed in the adult
               lpar3 KO fish, including a lower degree of aggression, less

              However, despite a perhaps unparalleled understanding of links
              between zebrafish brain circuits and visual behaviors,
              comparatively little is known about what their eyes send to the
              brain via retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Major gaps in knowledge
              include any information on spectral coding and information on

              a goal that unites many fields of biology. Yet, the diversity,
              flexibility, and multi-scale nature of these behaviors often make
              understanding elusive. Here, we review studies of animal pursuit
              and evasion - two special classes of behavior where theory-driven
              experiments and new modeling techniques are beginning to uncover
              the general control principles underlying natural behavior. A key
              finding of these studies is that intricate sequences of pursuit
              and evasion behavior can often be constructed through simple,
              repeatable rules that link sensory input to motor output: we
              refer to these rules as behavioral algorithms. Identifying and
              mathematically characterizing these algorithms has led to
              important insights, including the discovery of guidance rules
              that attacking predators use to intercept mobile prey, and
              coordinated neural and biomechanical mechanisms that animals use
              to avoid impending collisions. Here, we argue that algorithms
              provide a good starting point for studies of natural behavior

              levels of organization, we advocate starting in the middle, where
              the algorithms that link sensory input to behavioral output can
              provide a solid foundation from which to explore both the
              implementation and the ecological outcomes of behavior. We review

              The ablation of each cone type proved to be thorough (killing
              80\% of cells in each intended cone class), specific, and
              cell-autonomous. We assessed the loss and recovery of vision in
              larvae via the optomotor behavioural response (OMR). This
              visually mediated behaviour decreased to about 5\% or 20\% of
              control levels following ablation of UV or blue cones,
              respectively (P<0.05). We further assessed ocular photoreception
              by measuring the effects of UV light on body pigmentation, and
              observed that photoreceptor deficits and recovery occurred
              (p<0.01) with a timeline coincident to the OMR results. This
              corroborated and extended previous conclusions that UV cones are
              required photoreceptors for modulating body pigmentation,
              addressing assumptions that were unavoidable in previous
              experiments. Functional vision recovery following UV cone
              ablation was robust, as measured by both assays, returning to
              control levels within four days. In contrast, robust functional
              recovery following blue cone ablation was unexpectedly rapid,
              returning to normal levels within 24 hours after ablation.
              Ablation of cones led to increased proliferation in the retina,
              though the rapid recovery of vision following blue cone ablation
              was demonstrated to not be mediated by blue cone regeneration.
              Thus rapid visual recovery occurs following ablation of some, but
              not all, cone subtypes, suggesting an opportunity to contrast and

              process can be recaptured after regeneration of neurons in the
              damaged CNS remains unclear. Here, we harnessed the endogenous
              regenerative capacity of the zebrafish retina to reconstruct the
              circuitry of neurons produced after damage. We tracked the input
              connectivity of identified bipolar cell (BC) types across stages
              of retinal development and after BC regeneration. We found that
              BCs of each type generate a unique and stereotypic wiring pattern
              with cone photoreceptors by gaining synapses with specific
              photoreceptor types over time. After selective ablation, the
              targeted BC types are rapidly reproduced and largely re-establish
              their characteristic morphological features. The regenerated
              population connects with appropriate photoreceptor types and
              establishes the original number of synaptic contacts. However, BC
              types that normally bias their connectivity in favor of red cones
              fail to precisely recapture this synaptic partner preference upon
              regeneration. Furthermore, regenerated BCs succeed in forming
              synaptic specializations at their axon terminals, but in excess
              of the usual number. Altogether, we find that regenerated BCs
              reinstate some, but not all, major features of their stereotypic
              wiring, suggesting that circuit patterns may be unable to
              regenerate with the same fidelity as in development.",

              that standard husbandry practices in zebrafish are designed to
              maintain population diversity. While this diversity is attractive
              for translational applications in human and ecological health, it

              imaging in the field, in vivo 2-photon imaging of retinal
              neurons, and anatomy, here we show that larval zebrafish use a
              highly anisotropic retina to asymmetrically survey their natural
              visual world. First, different neurons dominate different parts
              of the eye and are linked to a systematic shift in inner retinal
              function: above the animal, there is little color in nature, and
              retinal circuits are largely achromatic. Conversely, the lower
              visual field and horizon are color rich and are predominately
              surveyed by chromatic and color-opponent circuits that are
              spectrally matched to the dominant chromatic axes in nature.
              Second, in the horizontal and lower visual field, bipolar cell
              terminals encoding achromatic and color-opponent visual features
              are systematically arranged into distinct layers of the inner
              retina. Third, above the frontal horizon, a high-gain UV system
              piggybacks onto retinal circuits, likely to support prey capture.",

              expressed in M{\"u}ller glia and a subset of amacrine cells,
              similar to other vertebrates. Following 31 h of light damage,
              Sox2 expression significantly increased in proliferating

              most easily be detected as visual whole-field motion with respect
              to the animal's frame of reference. Despite this, many aquatic
              animals consistently orient and swim against oncoming flows (a

              How animals achieve this task, and its underlying sensory basis,

              orienting towards or away from visual stimuli. We made
              extracellular recordings from single-units in the superficial

              stronger surround suppression also showed stronger adaptation
              effects. In neurons where it was present surround suppression was
              dynamic, and was reduced by adaptation. Adaptation's effects
              further revealed two components to surround suppression: one

              area important for directing behaviour. We also show that the two

  abstract = "The z-score method and its variants for testing mean difference
              are commonly used for hit selection in high-throughput screening
              (HTS) assays. Strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) offers
              a way to measure and classify the short interfering RNA (siRNA)
              effects. In this article, based on SSMD, the authors propose a
              new testing method for hit selection in RNA interference (RNAi)
              HTS assays. This SSMD-based method allows the differentiation
              between siRNAs with large and small effects on the assay output
              and maintains flexible and balanced control of both the
              false-negative rate, in which the siRNAs with strong effects are
              not selected as hits, and the restricted false-positive rate, in
              which the siRNAs with weak or no effects are selected as hits.
              This method directly addresses the size of siRNA effects
              represented by the strength of difference between an siRNA and a
              negative reference, whereas the classic z-score method and t-test
              of testing no mean difference address whether the mean of an
              siRNA is exactly the same as the mean of a negative reference.
              This method can readily control the false-negative rate, whereas
              it is nontrivial for the classic z-score method and t-test to
              control the false-negative rate. Therefore, theoretically, the
              SSMD-based method offers better control of the sizes of siRNA
              effects and the associated false-positive and false-negative
              rates than the commonly used z-score method and t-test for hit
              selection in HTS assays. The SSMD-based method should generally
              be applicable to any assay in which the end point is a difference

              RNAi, receptor, enzyme, and cellular function.",

              seizures, which are abnormal body movements or cognitive states

              Epilepsy has been found to have numerous etiologies and, although
              about two-thirds of epilepsies were classically considered
              idiopathic, the majority of those are now believed to be of
              genetic origin. Mutations in genes involved in gamma-aminobutyric
              acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission have been
              associated with a broad range of epilepsy syndromes. Mutations in
              the GABA-A receptor gamma 2 subunit gene (GABRG2), for example,
              have been associated with absence epilepsy and febrile seizures
              in humans. Several rodent models of GABRG2 loss of function
              depict clinical features of the disease; however, alternative
              genetic models more amenable for the study of ictogenesis and for
              high-throughput screening purposes are still needed. In this
              context, we generated a gabrg2 knockout (KO) zebrafish model
              (which we called R23X) that displayed light/dark-induced reflex
              seizures. Through high-resolution in vivo calcium imaging of the
              brain, we showed that this phenotype is associated with
              widespread increases in neuronal activity that can be effectively
              alleviated by the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid. Moreover,
              these seizures only occur at the larval stages but disappear
              after 1 week of age. Interestingly, our whole-transcriptome
              analysis showed that gabrg2 KO does not alter the expression of
              genes in the larval brain. As a result, the gabrg2-/- zebrafish
              is a novel in vivo genetic model of early epilepsies that opens

              mating behaviors, which, in vertebrates, are highly dependent on
              sex steroid signaling. While estradiol-17$\beta$ (E2) signaling
              through estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) serves to defeminize male
              mating behavior in rodents, the available evidence suggests that
              E2 signaling is not required in teleosts for either male or
              female mating behavior. Here, we report that female medaka
              deficient for Esr2b, a teleost ortholog of ESR2, are not
              receptive to males but rather court females, despite retaining
              normal ovarian function with an unaltered sex steroid milieu.
              Thus, contrary to both prevailing views in rodents and teleosts,
              E2/Esr2b signaling in the brain plays a decisive role in
              feminization and demasculinization of female mating behavior and
              sexual preference in medaka. Further behavioral testing showed
              that mutual antagonism between E2/Esr2b signaling and androgen
              receptor-mediated androgen signaling in adulthood induces and
              actively maintains sex-typical mating behaviors and preference.
              Our results also revealed that the female-biased sexual
              dimorphism in esr2b expression in the telencephalic and preoptic
              nuclei implicated in mating behavior can be reversed between
              males and females by altering the sex steroid milieu in
              adulthood, likely via mechanisms involving direct E2-induced
              transcriptional activation. In addition, Npba, a neuropeptide
              mediating female sexual receptivity, was found to act downstream
              of E2/Esr2b signaling in these brain nuclei. Collectively, these
              functional and regulatory mechanisms of E2/Esr2b signaling
              presumably underpin the neural mechanism for induction,
              maintenance, and reversal of sex-typical mating behaviors and
              sexual preference in teleosts, at least in medaka.",

              used to activate spinal networks to induce locomotion in
              spinalized animals. We recently described an alternative approach
              in which application of continuous blue light activates
              channelrhodopsin-2 in vesicular glutamate transporter 2a
              (vglut2a)-expressing spinal neurons to produce organized,
              rhythmic locomotor activity in spinally-transected larval
              zebrafish. This technique arguably enhances research validity,
              because endogenous glutamate is released into existing synapses
              instead of activating only a subset of glutamatergic (NMDA)
              receptors with an exogenous compound. Here, we explored the
              viability of this approach in the context of using it for
              longer-term experiments. Fictive swimming was induced through
              repetitive application of 10-s blue light stimuli to spinalized
              preparations for up to 60 min at intervals of 1, 3, or 15 min.
              Locomotor activity was maintained throughout the experimental
              timecourse, demonstrating the robustness of the system. Although
              locomotor bursts remained organized into episodes of activity,
              the number of bursts elicited during each successive stimulus
              decreased. This was in contrast to NMDA bath application, in
              which bursts became less episodically organized while the overall
              number of bursts remained unchanged. The efficacy of the
              repetitive optogenetic stimulation paradigm was demonstrated
              through application of exogenous dopamine, which reversibly
              decreased the number of bursts produced per stimulus compared
              with untreated preparations. Finally, increasing the stimulus
              interval to 15 min lessened, but did not eliminate locomotor
              fatigue from repetitive activation. Altogether, we established
              repetitive optogenetic stimulation of vglut2a-expressing neurons
              as a viable alternative to NMDA application for activation of the

              embryonic and larval zebrafish, introducing the term
              ``arborization fields'' (AFs) for the retinorecipient areas. AFs
              were numbered from 1 to 10 according to their positions along the
              optic tract. With the exception of AF10 (neuropil of the optic
              tectum), annotations of AFs remained tentative. Here we offer an
              update on the likely identities and functions of zebrafish AFs
              after successfully matching classical neuroanatomy to the digital
              Max Planck Zebrafish Brain Atlas. In our system, individual AFs
              are neuropil areas associated with the following nuclei: AF1 with
              the suprachiasmatic nucleus; AF2 with the posterior parvocellular
              preoptic nucleus; AF3 and AF4 with the ventrolateral thalamic
              nucleus; AF4 with the anterior and intermediate thalamic nuclei;
              AF5 with the dorsal accessory optic nucleus; AF7 with the
              parvocellular superficial pretectal nucleus; AF8 with the central
              pretectal nucleus; and AF9d and AF9v with the dorsal and ventral
              periventricular pretectal nuclei. AF6 is probably part of the
              accessory optic system. Imaging, ablation, and activation
              experiments showed contributions of AF5 and potentially AF6 to
              optokinetic and optomotor reflexes, AF4 to phototaxis, and AF7 to
              prey detection. AF6, AF8 and AF9v respond to dimming, and AF4 and
              AF9d to brightening. While few annotations remain tentative, it
              is apparent that the larval zebrafish visual system is
              anatomically and functionally continuous with its adult successor
              and fits the general cyprinid pattern. This study illustrates the

              somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SOM cells).
              Furthermore, when mice engage in sound-guided behavior, pyramidal

              which enables animals to ignore a familiar, unreinforced
              stimulus, is called habituation. Despite the ubiquity of this
              phenomenon, it is generally poorly understood in terms of the
              underlying neural circuitry. Hungry fruit flies show a proboscis
              extension reflex (PER) when sensory receptors are stimulated by
              sugars. The PER is usually followed by feeding. However, if
              feeding is disallowed following sugar stimulation, PER is no
              longer robust, and the animal is considered to be habituated to
              this stimulus. Our results suggest that PER habituation requires
              an adenylate cyclase-dependent enhancement of inhibitory output
              of GABAergic neurons in the subesophageal ganglion (SOG), which
              mediates PER. GABA synthesis in and release from glutamic acid
              decarboxylase (GAD1) expressing neurons is necessary, and GABA(A)
              receptors on cholinergic neurons are required for PER
              habituation. The proposed inhibitory potentiation requires
              glutamate/NMDA-receptor signaling, possibly playing a role in
              stimulus selectivity. We explain why these data provide
              significant and independent support for a general model in which

               and 8 years of age with a weighted (for N) average of normalized

               size of the predictive correlation is essentially the same for
               habituation and for recognition memory paradigms. (3) This
               prediction phenomenon is not obviously associated solely with
               one laboratory, one particular infant response measure, or a few
               extremely disordered infants. (4) The level of prediction to
               childhood IQ is substantial given the reliability of the infant
               measures. (5) Predictions are somewhat higher for risk than for
               nonrisk samples. (6) Predictions are consistently higher than
               for standardized infant tests of general development for nonrisk

               than predicting from parental education and socioeconomic status

              little is known about the cellular processes underlying its
              behavioral expression. Here, we review research on habituation in
              the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that addresses habituation at
              behavioral, neural circuit, and genetic levels. This work
              highlights the need to understand the dynamics of a behavior
              before attempting to determine its underlying mechanism. In many
              cases knowing the characteristics of a behavior can direct or
              guide a search for underlying cellular mechanisms. We have

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A continued effort in neuroscience aims to understand
              the way brain circuits consisting of diverse neuronal types
              generate complex behavior following sensory input. A common
              feature of vertebrate visual systems is that lower-order and
              higher-order visual areas are reciprocally connected. Feedforward
              projections confer visual responsiveness to higher-order visual
              neurons while feedback projections likely serve to modulate
              responses of lower-order visual neurons in a context-dependent
              manner. Optic tectum is the largest first-order visual brain area
              in zebrafish and is reciprocally connected with the torus
              longitudinalis (TL), a second-order visual brain area that does
              not receive retinal input. A functional role for feedback
              projections from TL to tectum has not been identified. Here we
              aim to understand how this feedback contributes to visual
              processing. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that TL
              feedback projections to tectum drive binocular integration and
              spatial summation in a defined tectal circuit. We performed
              genetically targeted, cell type-specific functional imaging in
              tectal pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) and their two input neuron
              populations: retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and neurons in TL. We
              find that PyrNs encode gradual changes in scene luminance using a
              complement of three distinct response classes that encode
              different light intensity ranges. Functional imaging of RGC
              inputs to tectum suggest that these response classes originate in
              the retina and RGC input specifies PyrN functional classes. In
              contrast, TL input serves to endow PyrNs with large, compound
              receptive fields that span both retinal hemifields. CONCLUSIONS:
              These findings reveal a novel role for the zebrafish TL in
              driving binocular integration and spatial summation in tectal
              PyrNs. The neural circuit we describe generates a population of
              tectal neurons with large receptive fields tailored for detecting
              changes in the visual scene.",

  abstract  = "Habituated animals retain a latent capacity for robust
               engagement with familiar stimuli. In most instances, the ability
               to override habituation is best explained by postulating that
               habituation arises from the potentiation of inhibitory inputs
               onto stimulus-encoding assemblies and that habituation override
               occurs through disinhibition. Previous work has shown that
               inhibitory plasticity contributes to specific forms of olfactory
               and gustatory habituation in Drosophila. Here we analyze how
               exposure to a novel stimulus causes override of gustatory
               (proboscis-extension reflex or ``PER'') habituation. While brief
               sucrose contact with tarsal hairs causes na{\"\i}ve Drosophila
               to extend their proboscis, persistent exposure reduces PER to
               subsequent sucrose stimuli. We show that in so habituated
               animals, either brief exposure of the proboscis to yeast or
               direct thermogenetic activation of sensory neurons restores PER
               response to tarsal sucrose stimulation. Similar override of PER
               habituation can also be induced by brief thermogenetic
               activation of a population of TH (Tyrosine-Hydroxylase) positive
               neurons, a subset of which send projections to the subesophagial
               zone (SEZ). Significantly, sensory-neuron induced habituation
               override requires transmitter release from these TH-positive
               cells. Treatments that cause override specifically influence the
               habituated state, with no effect on the na{\"\i}ve sucrose
               response across a range of concentrations. Taken together with
               other findings, these observations in female flies are
               consistent with a model in which novel taste stimuli trigger
               activity in dopaminergic neurons which, directly or indirectly,
               inhibit GABAergic cells that drive PER habituation. The
               implications of these findings for general mechanisms of
               attentional and sensory override of habituation are
               discussed.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHabituation can be overcome when
               a new context requires an enhanced response to a familiar
               stimulus. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely
               understood. Previous studies have provided evidence that
               habituation of the sucrose-induced proboscis extension reflex
               (PER) in Drosophila occurs through potentiation of inhibition
               onto the PER pathway. This work defines controlled protocols for
               override of PER habituation and uses them to outline the
               underlying circuit mechanisms. The results presented support a
               model in which novel taste stimuli cause dishabituation by
               activating a subset of tyrosine-hydroxylase-expressing neurons
               that inhibit GABAergic neurons whose potentiation underlies PER
               habituation. At a general level, these findings further

              which enables animals to ignore a familiar, unreinforced
              stimulus, is called habituation. Despite the ubiquity of this
              phenomenon, it is generally poorly understood in terms of the
              underlying neural circuitry. Hungry fruit flies show a proboscis
              extension reflex (PER) when sensory receptors are stimulated by
              sugars. The PER is usually followed by feeding. However, if
              feeding is disallowed following sugar stimulation, PER is no
              longer robust, and the animal is considered to be habituated to
              this stimulus. Our results suggest that PER habituation requires
              an adenylate cyclase-dependent enhancement of inhibitory output
              of GABAergic neurons in the subesophageal ganglion (SOG), which
              mediates PER. GABA synthesis in and release from glutamic acid

              glutamate/NMDA-receptor signaling, possibly playing a role in
              stimulus selectivity. We explain why these data provide

              grating stimuli in neocortical layer 4. The expression of SRP at

              vary depending on the neuronal type and how activity is measured.
              This form of plasticity is highly selective for stimulus features
              such as stimulus orientation, spatial frequency, and contrast.
              Several key insights into the significance and underlying
              mechanisms of SRP have recently been made. First, it occurs
              concomitantly and shares core mechanisms with behavioral
              habituation, indicating that SRP reflects the formation of
              long-term familiarity that can support recognition of innocuous
              stimuli. Second, SRP does not manifest within a recording session
              but only emerges after an off-line period of several hours that
              includes sleep. Third, SRP requires not only canonical molecular
              mechanisms of Hebbian synaptic plasticity within V1, but also the
              opposing engagement of two key subclasses of cortical inhibitory
              neuron: the parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing GABAergic
              interneurons. Fourth, pronounced shifts in the power of cortical
              oscillations from high frequency (gamma) to low frequency
              (alpha/beta) oscillations provide respective readouts of the
              engagement of these inhibitory neuronal subtypes following
              familiarization. In this article we will discuss the implications

              to one eye at a time has revealed that many such forms of
              plasticity are eye-specific, indicating that synaptic
              modification occurs prior to binocular integration of
              thalamocortical inputs. A common feature of these forms of
              plasticity is the requirement for NMDA receptor (NMDAR)
              activation in V1. We therefore hypothesized that NMDARs in
              cortical layer 4 (L4), which receives the densest thalamocortical
              input, would be necessary for all forms of NMDAR-dependent and

              disorders often associated with a dysregulated

              the emotional valence of light and the hypothalamus, and how they

              larval zebrafish with analogous hypothalamic systems to mammals,
              we show in free-swimming animals that hypothalamic corticotropin
              releasing factor (CRFHy) neurons promote dark avoidance, and such
              role is not shared by other hypothalamic peptidergic neurons.
              Single-neuron projection analyses uncover processes extended by
              individual CRFHy neurons to multiple targets including
              sensorimotor and decision-making areas. In vivo calcium imaging

  abstract = "Sleep disorders and chronic sleep disturbances are common and are
              associated with cardio-metabolic diseases and neuropsychiatric
              disorders. Several genetic pathways and neuronal mechanisms that
              regulate sleep have been described in animal models, but the
              genes underlying human sleep variation and sleep disorders are
              largely unknown. Identifying these genes is essential in order to
              develop effective therapies for sleep disorders and their
              associated comorbidities. To address this unmet health problem,
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous
              genetic variants associated with human sleep traits and sleep
              disorders. However, in most cases, it is unclear which gene is
              responsible for a sleep phenotype that is associated with a
              genetic variant. As a result, it is necessary to experimentally
              validate candidate genes identified by GWAS using an animal
              model. Rodents are ill-suited for this endeavor due to their poor
              amenability to high-throughput sleep assays and the high costs
              associated with generating, maintaining, and testing large
              numbers of mutant lines. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), an alternative
              vertebrate model for studying sleep, allows for the rapid and
              cost-effective generation of mutant lines using the CRISPR/Cas9
              system. Numerous zebrafish mutant lines can then be tested in
              parallel using high-throughput behavioral assays to identify
              genes whose loss affects sleep. This process identifies a gene
              associated with each GWAS hit that is likely responsible for the
              human sleep phenotype. This strategy is a powerful complement to
              GWAS approaches and holds great promise to identify the genetic

              Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior has been used to
              rapidly identify neuroactive compounds, it is not clear what
              types of behavioral assays would be necessary to identify
              multitarget compounds such as antipsychotics. Here we developed a
              battery of behavioral assays in larval zebrafish to determine
              whether behavioral profiles can provide sufficient phenotypic
              resolution to identify and classify psychiatric drugs. Using the
              antipsychotic drug haloperidol as a test case, we found that
              behavioral profiles of haloperidol-treated zebrafish could be
              used to identify previously uncharacterized compounds with
              desired antipsychotic-like activities and multitarget mechanisms

              concentrations of PTZ (used as a positive control), PTX or TETS

              relationship for seizure behavior was similar across zebrafish
              lines for each GABAAR antagonist, significantly less TETS was
              required to trigger seizures relative to PTX or PTZ. Recordings
              of extracellular field potentials in the optic tectum of 5 dpf

               leading to cognitive impairments in humans and rodents. Here, we
               investigated whether seizures in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)
               lead to acute and long-term learning deficits. Based on ELS
               studies in rodents, we hypothesized that seizures in larval
               zebrafish would impair their performance in declarative memory
               tasks. To test this, we induced seizures in larval zebrafish
               using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), which causes behavioral and
               electrical seizures in zebrafish. We modified the existing PTZ
               seizure model, exposing zebrafish to PTZ daily from 5-7 days
               post-fertilization (dpf). We then compared later-life learning
               through short-term memory tasks that lacked external punishment
               or motivation and focused on conscious recognition and interest
               in novel stimuli. To test learning and memory acutely after
               seizures, we used the visual lateralization novel object
               recognition (VLNOR) test, based on the novel object recognition
               test frequently used in rodents. Zebrafish show asymmetries in
               the use of left (LES) and right eye systems (RES), and will
               initially use LES to observe novel objects and RES to view
               familiar objects. We found that, when tested for recall of a
               previously novel object one hour after initially viewing it,
               12-14 dpf unhandled controls (UC group) reached a statistically
               significant majority of RES approaches by the end of the
               8-minute recall test (p=0.048). The PTZ group did not, and
               trended towards a significant decrease from 50\% in the first 2
               minute bin of the recall test (p=0.054). Taken together, these
               data indicate that the PTZ fish were not able to recall a
               previously viewed object, and when the object was reintroduced 1
               hour later, responded as if the object were novel. We next used
               a y-maze task to assess memory 3 months after seizures. In this
               task, fish had to recall the novel arm of the maze 90 minutes
               after being removed from the maze. The PTZ group spent
               significantly less time in the novel arm of the y-maze during
               the recall test compared to their UC clutchmates (mean \% time
               in novel arm +/- SE = 44.0+/-3.2 for UC, 29.7+/-2.1 for PTZ;
               p=0.002 by t-test). Furthermore, our preliminary molecular
               studies show distinct expression profiles of synaptic plasticity
               genes between PTZ and UC groups by qPCR. Taken together, these
               results imply that inducing seizures in larval zebrafish leads
               to both acute and chronic learning and memory impairments. These
               findings expand the behavioral characterization of the larval
               zebrafish seizure model, strengthening the power of this model

              We found that melatonin rapidly and reversibly enhanced I(GABA)
              in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 949 $\mu$M. Melatonin
              markedly enhanced the peak amplitude of a subsaturating I(GABA)
              but not that of a saturating I(GABA). Interestingly, melatonin
              was effective only when GABA and melatonin were applied together.
              Furthermore, the effect of melatonin on I(GABA) was
              voltage-independent and did not change the ion selectivity of the

              acts as the primary retinorecipient in the zebrafish brain.
              Homologous to the mammalian superior colliculus, the OT is
              responsible for the reception and integration of stimuli,
              followed by elicitation of salient behavioral responses. While
              the OT has been the focus of functional experiments for decades,
              less is known concerning specific cell types, microcircuitry, and
              their individual functions within the OT. Recent efforts have
              contributed substantially to the knowledge of tectal cell types;
              however, a comprehensive cell catalog is incomplete. Here we
              contribute to this growing effort by applying single-cell RNA
              Sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptomic
              profiles of tectal cells labeled by the transgenic enhancer trap
              line y304Et(cfos:Gal4;UAS:Kaede). We sequenced 13,320 cells, a 4X
              cellular coverage, and identified 25 putative OT cell
              populations. Within those cells, we identified several mature and
              developing neuronal populations, as well as non-neuronal cell
              types including oligodendrocytes and microglia. Although most
              mature neurons demonstrate GABAergic activity, several
              glutamatergic populations are present, as well as one glycinergic
              population. We also conducted Gene Ontology analysis to identify
              enriched biological processes, and computed RNA velocity to infer
              current and future transcriptional cell states. Finally, we
              conducted in situ hybridization to validate our bioinformatic
              analyses and spatially map select clusters. In conclusion, the
              larval zebrafish OT is a complex structure containing at least 25
              transcriptionally distinct cell populations. To our knowledge,

              in vivo analyses of neural circuitry controlling visually guided
              behaviors. However, there is a lack of information regarding
              specific cell types in the major retinorecipient brain region of
              the fish, the optic tectum. Here we report the characterization
              of three previously unidentified tectal cell types that are
              specifically labeled by dlx5/6 enhancer elements. In vivo
              laser-scanning microscopy in conjunction with ex vivo array
              tomography revealed that these neurons differ in their
              morphologies, synaptic connectivity, and neurotransmitter
              phenotypes. The first type is an excitatory bistratified
              periventricular interneuron that forms a dendritic arbor in the
              retinorecipient stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale (SFGS)
              and an axonal arbor in the stratum griseum centrale (SGC). The
              second type, a GABAergic non-stratified periventricular
              interneuron, extends a bushy arbor containing both dendrites and
              axons into the SGC and the deepest sublayers of the SFGS. The
              third type is a GABAergic periventricular projection neuron that
              extends a dendritic arbor into the SGC and a long axon to the
              torus semicircularis, medulla oblongata, and anterior hindbrain.
              Interestingly, the same axons form en passant synapses within the
              deepest neuropil layer of the tectum, the stratum album centrale.
              This approach revealed several novel aspects of tectal circuitry,
              including: (1) a glutamatergic mode of transmission from the
              superficial, retinorecipient neuropil layers to the deeper,
              output layers, (2) the presence of interneurons with mixed
              dendrite/axon arbors likely involved in local processing, and (3)
              a heretofore unknown GABAergic tectofugal projection to midbrain
              and hindbrain. These observations establish a framework for
              studying the morphological and functional differentiation of

              Zebrafish larvae can perceive binocular cues during prey hunting

              animals to adapt their behavior to changes in their sensory
              environment. Although habituation is considered a simple form of
              learning, the identification of a multitude of molecular pathways
              including several neurotransmitter systems that regulate this
              process suggests an unexpected level of complexity. How the
              vertebrate brain integrates these various pathways to accomplish
              habituation learning, whether they act independently or intersect
              with one another, and whether they act via divergent or
              overlapping neural circuits has remained unclear. To address
              these questions, we combined pharmacogenetic pathway analysis
              with unbiased whole-brain activity mapping using the larval
              zebrafish. This approach revealed five distinct molecular and
              circuit modules that regulate habituation learning and identified
              a set of molecularly defined brain regions associated with four
              of the five modules. Moreover, we find that in module 1 the
              palmitoyltransferase Hip14 cooperates with dopamine and NMDA
              signaling to drive plasticity, while in module 3 the adaptor
              protein complex subunit Ap2s1 drives habituation by antagonizing
              dopamine signaling, revealing two distinct and opposing roles for
              dopaminergic neuromodulation in the regulation of learning.
              Combined, our results define a core set of distinct modules that
              act in concert to regulate learning-associated plasticity, and
              provide compelling evidence that even seemingly simple learning
              behaviors in a compact vertebrate brain are regulated by a

  abstract = "Experience-dependent modifications of neural circuits and
              function are believed to heavily depend on changes in synaptic
              efficacy such as LTP/LTD. Hence, much effort has been devoted to
              elucidating the mechanisms underlying these forms of synaptic
              plasticity. Although most of this work has focused on excitatory
              synapses, it is now clear that diverse mechanisms of long-term
              inhibitory plasticity have evolved to provide additional
              flexibility to neural circuits. By changing the
              excitatory/inhibitory balance, GABAergic plasticity can regulate
              excitability, neural circuit function and ultimately, contribute
              to learning and memory, and neural circuit refinement. Here we
              discuss recent advancements in our understanding of the
              mechanisms and functional relevance of GABAergic inhibitory

              transcriptome of activated neurons can offer insight into
              molecular dynamics associated with differential neuronal
              responses to a given experience. Through evaluation of common

              induction of activity, including immediate early genes (IEGs)
              such as Fos, Arc and Egr1. SnRNA-seq of mouse dentate granule
              cells reveals large-scale changes in the activated neuronal
              transcriptome after brief novel environment exposure, including
              induction of MAPK pathway genes. In addition, we observe a
              continuum of activation states, revealing a pseudotemporal
              pattern of activation from gene expression alone. In summary,
              snRNA-seq of activated neurons enables the examination of gene
              expression beyond IEGs, allowing for novel insights into neuronal

              inter- and intralaminar heterogeneity in the induction of

              mechanisms: feedback control and internal-model-based control.
              Feedback controllers can maintain the sensory state of the animal
              at a desired level under different environmental conditions. In
              contrast, internal models learn the relationship between the
              motor output and its sensory consequences and can be used to
              recalibrate behaviors. Here, we present multiple unpredictable
              perturbations in visual feedback to larval zebrafish performing
              the optomotor response and show that they react to these
              perturbations through a feedback control mechanism. In contrast,
              if a perturbation is long-lasting, fish adapt their behavior by
              updating a cerebellum-dependent internal model. We use modelling
              and functional imaging to show that the neuronal requirements for
              these mechanisms are met in the larval zebrafish brain. Our
              results illustrate the role of the cerebellum in encoding
              internal models and how these can calibrate neuronal circuits
