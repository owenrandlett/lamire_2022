              in identifying novel therapeutic chemicals, yet this approach has
              not been exploited to identify new cognitive enhancers. Here we
              present an automated high-throughput system for measuring
              nonassociative learning behaviors in larval zebrafish. Using this
              system, we report that spaced training blocks of repetitive
              visual stimuli elicit protein synthesis-dependent long-term
              habituation in larval zebrafish, lasting up to 24 h. Moreover,
              repetitive acoustic stimulation induces robust short-term
              habituation that can be modulated by stimulation frequency and
              instantaneously dishabituated through cross-modal stimulation. To
              characterize the neurochemical pathways underlying short-term
              habituation, we screened 1,760 bioactive compounds with known
              targets. Although we found extensive functional conservation of
              short-term learning between larval zebrafish and mammalian
              models, we also discovered several compounds with previously
              unknown roles in learning. These compounds included a myristic
              acid analog known to interact with Src family kinases and an
              inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase 2, demonstrating that
              high-throughput chemical screens combined with high-resolution

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A continued effort in neuroscience aims to understand
              the way brain circuits consisting of diverse neuronal types
              generate complex behavior following sensory input. A common
              feature of vertebrate visual systems is that lower-order and
              higher-order visual areas are reciprocally connected. Feedforward
              projections confer visual responsiveness to higher-order visual
              neurons while feedback projections likely serve to modulate
              responses of lower-order visual neurons in a context-dependent
              manner. Optic tectum is the largest first-order visual brain area
              in zebrafish and is reciprocally connected with the torus
              longitudinalis (TL), a second-order visual brain area that does
              not receive retinal input. A functional role for feedback
              projections from TL to tectum has not been identified. Here we
              aim to understand how this feedback contributes to visual
              processing. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that TL
              feedback projections to tectum drive binocular integration and
              spatial summation in a defined tectal circuit. We performed
              genetically targeted, cell type-specific functional imaging in
              tectal pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) and their two input neuron
              populations: retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and neurons in TL. We
              find that PyrNs encode gradual changes in scene luminance using a
              complement of three distinct response classes that encode
              different light intensity ranges. Functional imaging of RGC
              inputs to tectum suggest that these response classes originate in
              the retina and RGC input specifies PyrN functional classes. In
              contrast, TL input serves to endow PyrNs with large, compound
              receptive fields that span both retinal hemifields. CONCLUSIONS:
              These findings reveal a novel role for the zebrafish TL in
              driving binocular integration and spatial summation in tectal
              PyrNs. The neural circuit we describe generates a population of
              tectal neurons with large receptive fields tailored for detecting
              changes in the visual scene.",

              the GABA-induced current (I(GABA) and GABAergic miniature
              inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in cultured rat
              hippocampal neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.
              We found that melatonin rapidly and reversibly enhanced I(GABA)
              in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 949 $\mu$M. Melatonin
              markedly enhanced the peak amplitude of a subsaturating I(GABA)
              but not that of a saturating I(GABA). Interestingly, melatonin
              was effective only when GABA and melatonin were applied together.
              Furthermore, the effect of melatonin on I(GABA) was
              voltage-independent and did not change the ion selectivity of the
              GABA(A) receptor. The melatonin enhancement on I(GABA) can not be
              blocked by luzindole, a melatonin receptor antagonist, indicating
              that melatonin-induced I(GABA) enhancement was not via activation
              of its own membrane receptors. However, this enhancement may be
              mediated via high-affinity benzodiazepine sites as it was
              inhibited by the classical benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil,
              suggesting an allosteric modulation of melatonin by binding to
              the sites of GABA(A) receptors. In addition, melatonin increased
              both amplitude and frequency of GABAergic mIPSCs, indicating that
              melatonin enhances GABAergic inhibitory transmission. Hence, our
              observation that melatonin has an enhancing effect on the
              GABAergic system may implicate a potential pathway for the

              threat agents, similarly trigger seizures in zebrafish larvae.
              Larvae of three, routinely used laboratory zebrafish lines,
              Tropical 5D, NHGRI and Tupfel long fin, were exposed to varying
              concentrations of PTZ (used as a positive control), PTX or TETS
              for 20 min at 5 days post fertilization (dpf). Acute exposure to
              PTZ, PTX or TETS triggered seizure behavior in the absence of
              morbidity or mortality. While the concentration-effect
              relationship for seizure behavior was similar across zebrafish
              lines for each GABAAR antagonist, significantly less TETS was
              required to trigger seizures relative to PTX or PTZ. Recordings
              of extracellular field potentials in the optic tectum of 5 dpf
              Tropical 5D zebrafish confirmed that all three GABAAR antagonists
              elicited extracellular spiking patterns consistent with seizure
              activity, although the pattern varied between chemicals.

              following 12 days but not 3 days of treatment. In addition,
              performance during acquisition of the eight arms baited maze task
              was better in estrogen-treated Ovx rats than in Ovx rats.
              Performance of treated rats was also enhanced in win-shift trials
              conducted 12 days postestrogen treatment. Working, reference, and
              working-reference memory was examined when four of the eight arms
              were baited, and only working memory was improved by estrogen and
              only after long-term treatment. Activity of Ovx rats on an open
              field, crossings and rearings, was increased at 5 but not at 35
              days following estrogen treatment. In medial prefrontal cortex,
              levels of NE, DA, and 5-HT were decreased but glutamate and GABA
              levels were not affected following chronic estrogen treatment.
              Basal forebrain nuclei also showed changes in monoamines
              following estrogen. Hippocampal subfields showed no effects of
              estrogen treatment on monoaminergic or amino acid transmitters.
              Levels of GABA were increased in the vertical diagonal bands
              following chronic estrogen. Results show that estrogen enhances
              learning/memory on a task utilizing spatial memory. Effects in
              Ovx rats appear to require the chronic (several days) presence of
              estrogen. Changes in activity of both monoaminergic and amino
              acid transmitters in the frontal cortex and basal forebrain may
              contribute to enhancing effects of estrogen on learning/memory.",

              is organized hierarchically such that the suprachiasmatic nucleus

              It is unknown whether more ancient brain regions contain such

              Fish displaced by water currents must prevent uncontrolled drift

  abstract  = "Habituated animals retain a latent capacity for robust
               engagement with familiar stimuli. In most instances, the ability
               to override habituation is best explained by postulating that
               habituation arises from the potentiation of inhibitory inputs
               onto stimulus-encoding assemblies and that habituation override
               occurs through disinhibition. Previous work has shown that
               inhibitory plasticity contributes to specific forms of olfactory
               and gustatory habituation in Drosophila. Here we analyze how
               exposure to a novel stimulus causes override of gustatory
               (proboscis-extension reflex or ``PER'') habituation. While brief
               sucrose contact with tarsal hairs causes na{\"\i}ve Drosophila
               to extend their proboscis, persistent exposure reduces PER to
               subsequent sucrose stimuli. We show that in so habituated
               animals, either brief exposure of the proboscis to yeast or
               direct thermogenetic activation of sensory neurons restores PER
               response to tarsal sucrose stimulation. Similar override of PER
               habituation can also be induced by brief thermogenetic
               activation of a population of TH (Tyrosine-Hydroxylase) positive
               neurons, a subset of which send projections to the subesophagial
               zone (SEZ). Significantly, sensory-neuron induced habituation
               override requires transmitter release from these TH-positive
               cells. Treatments that cause override specifically influence the
               habituated state, with no effect on the na{\"\i}ve sucrose
               response across a range of concentrations. Taken together with
               other findings, these observations in female flies are
               consistent with a model in which novel taste stimuli trigger
               activity in dopaminergic neurons which, directly or indirectly,
               inhibit GABAergic cells that drive PER habituation. The
               implications of these findings for general mechanisms of
               attentional and sensory override of habituation are
               discussed.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHabituation can be overcome when
               a new context requires an enhanced response to a familiar
               stimulus. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely
               understood. Previous studies have provided evidence that
               habituation of the sucrose-induced proboscis extension reflex
               (PER) in Drosophila occurs through potentiation of inhibition
               onto the PER pathway. This work defines controlled protocols for
               override of PER habituation and uses them to outline the
               underlying circuit mechanisms. The results presented support a
               model in which novel taste stimuli cause dishabituation by
               activating a subset of tyrosine-hydroxylase-expressing neurons
               that inhibit GABAergic neurons whose potentiation underlies PER
               habituation. At a general level, these findings further
               highlight a central role for inhibition and disinhibition in the
               control of behavioral flexibility.",

              which enables animals to ignore a familiar, unreinforced
              stimulus, is called habituation. Despite the ubiquity of this
              phenomenon, it is generally poorly understood in terms of the
              underlying neural circuitry. Hungry fruit flies show a proboscis
              extension reflex (PER) when sensory receptors are stimulated by
              sugars. The PER is usually followed by feeding. However, if
              feeding is disallowed following sugar stimulation, PER is no
              longer robust, and the animal is considered to be habituated to
              this stimulus. Our results suggest that PER habituation requires
              an adenylate cyclase-dependent enhancement of inhibitory output
              of GABAergic neurons in the subesophageal ganglion (SOG), which
              mediates PER. GABA synthesis in and release from glutamic acid

              behavior is a fundamental question in systems neuroscience. Using
              larval zebrafish, we study the temporal component of phototaxis,
              which is defined as orientation decisions based on comparisons of
              light intensity at successive moments in time. We developed a
              novel ``Virtual Circle'' assay where whole-field illumination is
              abruptly turned off when the fish swims out of a virtually
              defined circular border, and turned on again when it returns into
              the circle. The animal receives no direct spatial cues and
              experiences only whole-field temporal light changes. Remarkably,
              the fish spends most of its time within the invisible virtual
              border. Behavioral analyses of swim bouts in relation to light
              transitions were used to develop four discrete temporal
              algorithms that transform the binary visual input (uniform
              light/uniform darkness) into the observed spatial behavior. In
              these algorithms, the turning angle is dependent on the
              behavioral history immediately preceding individual turning
              events. Computer simulations show that the algorithms recapture
              most of the swim statistics of real fish. We discovered that
              turning properties in larval zebrafish are distinctly modulated
              by temporal step functions in light intensity in combination with
              the specific motor history preceding these turns. Several aspects
              of the behavior suggest memory usage of up to 10 swim bouts (~10
              sec). Thus, we show that a complex behavior like spatial

Although habituation is considered a simple form of learning, the identification of a multitude of molecular pathways including several neurotransmitter systems that regulate this process suggests an unexpected level of complexity. How the vertebrate brain integrates these various pathways to accomplish habituation learning, whether they act independently or intersect with one another, and whether they act via divergent or overlapping neural circuits has remained unclear. To address these questions, we combined pharmacogenetic pathway analysis with unbiased whole-brain activity mapping using the larval zebrafish. Based on our findings, we propose five distinct molecular modules for the regulation of habituation learning and identify a set of molecularly defined brain regions associated with four of the five modules. Moreover, we find that in module 1 the palmitoyltransferase Hip14 cooperates with dopamine and NMDA signaling to drive habituation, while in module 3 the adaptor protein complex subunit Ap2s1 drives habituation by antagonizing dopamine signaling, revealing two distinct and opposing roles for dopaminergic neuromodulation in the regulation of behavioral plasticity. Combined, our results define a core set of distinct modules that we propose act in concert to regulate habituation-associated plasticity, and provide compelling evidence that even seemingly simple learning behaviors in a compact vertebrate brain are regulated by a complex and overlapping set of molecular mechanisms.},

              reflexive escape response, the C-start, in zebrafish larvae. The

  abstract = "The optically transparent larval zebrafish is ideally suited for
              in vivo analyses of neural circuitry controlling visually guided
              behaviors. However, there is a lack of information regarding
              specific cell types in the major retinorecipient brain region of
              the fish, the optic tectum. Here we report the characterization
              of three previously unidentified tectal cell types that are
              specifically labeled by dlx5/6 enhancer elements. In vivo
              laser-scanning microscopy in conjunction with ex vivo array
              tomography revealed that these neurons differ in their
              morphologies, synaptic connectivity, and neurotransmitter
              phenotypes. The first type is an excitatory bistratified
              periventricular interneuron that forms a dendritic arbor in the
              retinorecipient stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale (SFGS)
              and an axonal arbor in the stratum griseum centrale (SGC). The
              second type, a GABAergic non-stratified periventricular
              interneuron, extends a bushy arbor containing both dendrites and
              axons into the SGC and the deepest sublayers of the SFGS. The
              third type is a GABAergic periventricular projection neuron that
              extends a dendritic arbor into the SGC and a long axon to the
              torus semicircularis, medulla oblongata, and anterior hindbrain.
              Interestingly, the same axons form en passant synapses within the
              deepest neuropil layer of the tectum, the stratum album centrale.
              This approach revealed several novel aspects of tectal circuitry,
              including: (1) a glutamatergic mode of transmission from the
              superficial, retinorecipient neuropil layers to the deeper,
              output layers, (2) the presence of interneurons with mixed
              dendrite/axon arbors likely involved in local processing, and (3)
              a heretofore unknown GABAergic tectofugal projection to midbrain
              and hindbrain. These observations establish a framework for

              from potentiation of inhibitory transmission within a circuit
              motif commonly repeated in the nervous system. In Drosophila,
              prior odorant exposure results in a selective reduction of
              response to this odorant. Both short-term (STH) and long-term
              (LTH) forms of olfactory habituation require function of the
              rutabaga-encoded adenylate cyclase in multiglomerular local
              interneurons (LNs) that mediate GABAergic inhibition in the
              antennal lobe; LTH additionally requires function of the cAMP
              response element-binding protein (CREB2) transcription factor in
              LNs. The odorant selectivity of STH and LTH is mirrored by
              requirement for NMDA receptors and GABA(A) receptors in
              odorant-selective, glomerulus-specific projection neurons(PNs).
              The need for the vesicular glutamate transporter in LNs indicates
              that a subset of these GABAergic neurons also releases glutamate.
              LTH is associated with a reduction of odorant-evoked calcium
              fluxes in PNs as well as growth of the respective
              odorant-responsive glomeruli. These cellular changes use similar
              mechanisms to those required for behavioral habituation. Taken
              together with the observation that enhancement of GABAergic
              transmission is sufficient to attenuate olfactory behavior, these
              data indicate that habituation arises from glomerulus-selective
              potentiation of inhibitory synapses in the antennal lobe. We
              suggest that similar circuit mechanisms may operate in other

              largely unknown. Zebrafish larvae have a defined locomotor
              repertoire as well as a simple nervous system and are therefore
              an attractive vertebrate system in which to study this process.
              Here we describe a high-throughput system for quantifying the
              kinematics of motor events in zebrafish larvae in order to
              measure the initiation frequency of different maneuvers. We use
              this system to analyze responses to photic stimuli and find that
              larvae respond to changes in illumination with both acute
              responses and extended behavioral programs. Reductions in
              illumination elicit large angle turns, distinct from startle
              responses, which orient larvae toward the source of light. In
              continuing darkness, larvae are transiently hyperactive before
              adopting a quiescent state. Indeed, locomotor activity is
              controlled by the state of light or dark adaptation similar to
              masking phenomena in higher vertebrates where light directly
              regulates motor activity. We propose that regulation of motor
              activity by photic stimuli in zebrafish larvae serves a

  author   = "Glanzman, David L",
  abstract = "The marine snail, Aplysia californica, is a valuable model system
              for cell biological studies of learning and memory. Aplysia
              exhibits a reflexive withdrawal of its gill and siphon in
              response to weak or moderate tactile stimulation of its skin.
              Repeated tactile stimulation causes this defensive withdrawal
              reflex to habituate. Both short-term habituation, lasting 24h,
              have been reported in Aplysia. Habituation of the withdrawal
              reflex correlates with, and is in part due to, depression of
              transmission at the monosynaptic connection between
              mechanoreceptive sensory neurons and motor neurons within the
              abdominal ganglion. Habituation-related short-term depression of
              the sensorimotor synapse appears to be due exclusively to
              presynaptic changes. However, changes within the sensory neuron,
              by themselves, do not account for more persistent depression of
              the sensorimotor synapse. Recent behavioral work suggests that
              long-term habituation in Aplysia critically involves postsynaptic
              processes, specifically, activation of AMPA- and NMDA-type
              receptors. In addition, long-term habituation requires activity
              of protein phosphatases, including protein phosphatases 1, 2A,
              and 2B, as well as activity of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.
              Cellular work has succeeded in demonstrating long-term,
              homosynaptic depression (LTD) of the sensorimotor synapse in
              dissociated cell culture and, more recently, LTD of the glutamate
              response of isolated motor neurons in culture (``hemisynaptic''
              LTD). These in vitro forms of LTD have mechanistic parallels to
              long-term habituation. In particular, homosynaptic LTD of the
              sensorimotor synapse requires elevated intracellular Ca2+ within
              the motor neuron, and hemisynaptic LTD requires activity of AMPA-

              advances in genetics, imaging, and computational methods now

              references and may not be aligned to the same coordinate space.
              Two recent larval zebrafish atlases exemplify this problem:
              Z-Brain, containing gene expression, neural activity, and
              neuroanatomical segmentations, was acquired using
              immunohistochemical stains, while the Zebrafish Brain Browser

              potential ``bridges'' for transforming each into the other's
              coordinate space. We tested multiple bridging channels and
              registration algorithms and found that the symmetric
              diffeomorphic normalization algorithm improved live brain
              registration precision while better preserving cell morphology
              than B-spline-based registrations. Symmetric diffeomorphic
              normalization also corrected for tissue distortion introduced
              during fixation. Multi-reference channel optimization provided a
              transformation that enabled Z-Brain and ZBB to be co-aligned with
              precision of approximately a single cell diameter and minimal
              perturbation of cell and tissue morphology. Finally, we developed
              software to visualize brain regions in 3 dimensions, including a
              virtual reality neuroanatomy explorer. This study demonstrates
              the feasibility of integrating whole brain datasets, despite
              disparate reference templates and acquisition protocols, when

              than 50 structural RGC types with unique combinations of
              dendritic and axonal morphologies, exceeding current estimates of
              RGC diversity in vertebrates. These single-cell projection
              mapping data indicate that specific projection patterns are
              nonuniformly specified in the retina to generate retinotopically
              biased visual maps throughout the brain. The retinal projectome
              also successfully predicted a functional subdivision of the
              pretectum. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that RGC projection
              patterns are precisely coordinated to generate
              brain-area-specific visual representations originating from RGCs
              with distinct dendritic morphologies and topographic
              distributions.",

              risk genes and gene variants of unknown functional significance.
              Here, we used Caenorhabditis elegans to systematically
              functionally characterize ASD-associated genes in vivo. Using our
              custom machine vision system, we quantified 26 phenotypes
              spanning morphology, locomotion, tactile sensitivity, and
              habituation learning in 135 strains each carrying a mutation in
              an ortholog of an ASD-associated gene. We identified hundreds of
              genotype-phenotype relationships ranging from severe
              developmental delays and uncoordinated movement to subtle
              deficits in sensory and learning behaviors. We clustered genes by
              similarity in phenomic profiles and used epistasis analysis to
              discover parallel networks centered on CHD8•chd-7 and NLGN3•nlg-1
              that underlie mechanosensory hyperresponsivity and impaired
              habituation learning. We then leveraged our data for in vivo
              functional assays to gauge missense variant effect. Expression of
              wild-type NLG-1 in nlg-1 mutant C. elegans rescued their sensory
              and learning impairments. Testing the rescuing ability of
              conserved ASD-associated neuroligin variants revealed varied
              partial loss of function despite proper subcellular localization.
              Finally, we used CRISPR-Cas9 auxin-inducible degradation to
              determine that phenotypic abnormalities caused by developmental
              loss of NLG-1 can be reversed by adult expression. This work

  abstract = "The sleep-promoting effect of the pineal hormone melatonin in
              humans is known for decades. However, the mechanisms of this
              phenomenon remain obscure, mainly due to lack of a simple,
              genetically tractable, animal model. We now report that melatonin
              promotes sleep-like state in a diurnal lower vertebrate,
              zebrafish (Danio rerio), and this effect is mediated through
              activation of specific melatonin membrane receptors. Furthermore,
              our data show that the sleep-like state in zebrafish has
              fundamental similarities with sleep in mammals, including
              characteristic postures, elevated arousal threshold to sensory
              stimulation and a compensatory rest rebound following rest
              deprivation, and can be induced by conventional hypnotics,
              diazepam and sodium pentobarbital. Collectively, these data
              indicate that melatonin is evolutionary conserved sleep-promoting
              agent in diurnal species and suggest that zebrafish provide an
              efficient animal model for studying the molecular mechanisms of

  abstract = "Habituation is a simple form of learning where animals learn to
              reduce their responses to repeated innocuous stimuli [1].
              Habituation is thought to occur via at least two temporally and
              molecularly distinct mechanisms, which lead to short-term
              memories that last for seconds to minutes and long-term memories
              that last for hours or longer [1, 2]. Here, we focus on long-term
              habituation, which, due to the extended time course, necessitates
              stable alterations to circuit properties [2-4]. In its simplest
              form, long-term habituation could result from a plasticity event
              at a single point in a circuit, and many studies have focused on
              identifying the site and underlying mechanism of plasticity
              [5-10]. However, it is possible that these individual sites are
              only one of many points in the circuit where plasticity is
              occurring. Indeed, studies of short-term habituation in C.
              elegans indicate that in this paradigm, multiple genetically
              separable mechanisms operate to adapt specific aspects of
              behavior [11-13]. Here, we use a visual assay in which larval
              zebrafish habituate their response to sudden reductions in
              illumination (dark flashes) [14, 15]. Through behavioral
              analyses, we find that multiple components of the dark-flash
              response habituate independently of one another using different
              molecular mechanisms. This is consistent with a modular model in
              which habituation originates from multiple independent processes,
              each adapting specific components of behavior. This may allow
              animals to more specifically or flexibly habituate based on
              stimulus context or internal states.",

  abstract  = "Learning to recognize and filter familiar, irrelevant sensory
               stimuli eases the computational burden on the cerebral cortex.
               Inhibition is a candidate mechanism in this filtration process,
               and oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP)
               serve as markers of the engagement of different inhibitory
               neurons. We show here that LFP oscillatory activity in visual
               cortex is profoundly altered as male and female mice learn to
               recognize an oriented grating stimulus-low frequency (∼15 Hz
               peak) power sharply increases while high frequency (∼65 Hz peak)
               power decreases. These changes report recognition of the
               familiar pattern, as they disappear when the stimulus is rotated
               to a novel orientation. Two-photon imaging of neuronal activity
               reveals that parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons disengage
               with familiar stimuli and reactivate to novelty, whereas
               somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons show opposing
               activity patterns. We propose a model in which the balance of
               two interacting interneuron circuits shifts as novel stimuli
               become familiar.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:Habituation, familiarity
               and novelty detection are fundamental cognitive processes that
               enable organisms to adaptively filter meaningless stimuli and
               focus attention on potentially important elements of their
               environment. We have shown that this process can be studied
               fruitfully in the mouse primary visual cortex by using simple
               grating stimuli for which novelty and familiarity are defined by
               orientation, and by measuring stimulus-evoked and continuous
               local field potentials. Altered event-related and spontaneous
               potentials, and deficient habituation, are well-documented
               features of several neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders.
               The paradigm described here will be valuable to interrogate the
               origins of these signals and the meaning of their disruption

               mechanisms: feedback control and internal-model-based control.
               Feedback controllers can maintain the sensory state of the
               animal at a desired level under different environmental
               conditions. In contrast, internal models learn the relationship
               between the motor output and its sensory consequences and can be
               used to recalibrate behaviors. Here, we present multiple
               unpredictable perturbations in visual feedback to larval
               zebrafish performing the optomotor response and show that they
               react to these perturbations through a feedback control

               adapt their behavior by updating a cerebellum-dependent internal
